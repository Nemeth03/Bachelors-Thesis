Marek loved the mountains. Every weekend, he went hiking in the Tatra valleys to escape the noise of the city. This time, however, he decided to go alone. He wanted to test his skills and enjoy the silence of nature.

The morning was beautiful. The sun illuminated the treetops, and the air smelled of pine. Marek walked along a narrow trail, feeling free. But as he climbed higher, the weather began to change. The sky darkened, and the wind grew stronger. Suddenly, a thick fog rolled in, covering the entire valley.

Marek decided to turn back, but the more he walked, the more he realized he had lost his way. The path that once seemed familiar now branched into the unknown. His phone had no signal, and his footsteps echoed in the silent forest.

He began to feel uneasy. His heart beat faster, but he tried to stay calm. He remembered the rule: when lost, stop and think. He sat down on a fallen tree and analyzed the situation. After a moment, he recalled some landmarks he had passed earlier. He decided to follow the flow of a small stream, which might lead him back to the valley.

After an hour of exhausting walking, he heard familiar soundsâ€”voices of other hikers. He emerged from the forest onto a trail where he met a group who showed him the right way back. A wave of relief washed over him, and he promised himself never to underestimate the mountains again.

When he returned home, he poured himself a cup of hot tea and smiled, knowing this was a trip he would never forget.
