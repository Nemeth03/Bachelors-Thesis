chapter
i
the
studio
was
filled
with
the
rich
odour
of
roses
,
and
when
the
light
summer
wind
stirred
amidst
the
trees
of
the
garden
,
there
came
through
the
open
door
the
heavy
scent
of
the
lilac
,
or
the
more
delicate
perfume
of
the
pink
-
flowering
thorn
.
from
the
corner
of
the
divan
of
persian
saddlebags
on
which
he
was
lying
,
smoking
,
as
was
his
custom
,
innumerable
cigarettes
,
lord
henry
wotton
could
just
catch
the
gleam
of
the
honey
-
sweet
and
honey
-
coloured
blossoms
of
a
laburnum
,
whose
tremulous
branches
seemed
hardly
able
to
bear
the
burden
of
a
beauty
so
flame
-
like
as
theirs
;
and
now
and
then
the
fantastic
shadows
of
birds
in
flight
flitted
across
the
long
tussore
-
silk
curtains
that
were
stretched
in
front
of
the
huge
window
,
producing
a
kind
of
momentary
japanese
effect
,
and
making
him
think
of
those
pallid
jade
-
faced
painters
of
tokio
who
,
through
the
medium
of
an
art
that
is
necessarily
immobile
,
seek
to
convey
the
sense
of
swiftness
and
motion
.
the
sullen
murmur
of
the
bees
shouldering
their
way
through
the
long
unmown
grass
,
or
circling
with
monotonous
insistence
round
the
dusty
gilt
horns
of
the
straggling
woodbine
,
seemed
to
make
the
stillness
more
oppressive
.
the
dim
roar
of
london
was
like
the
bourdon
note
of
a
distant
organ
.
in
the
centre
of
the
room
,
clamped
to
an
upright
easel
,
stood
the
full
-
length
portrait
of
a
young
man
of
extraordinary
personal
beauty
,
and
in
front
of
it
,
some
little
distance
away
,
was
sitting
the
artist
himself
,
basil
hallward
,
whose
sudden
disappearance
some
years
ago
caused
,
at
the
time
,
such
public
excitement
,
and
gave
rise
to
so
many
strange
conjectures
.
as
the
painter
looked
at
the
gracious
and
comely
form
he
had
so
skilfully
mirrored
in
his
art
,
a
smile
of
pleasure
passed
across
his
face
,
and
seemed
about
to
linger
there
.
but
he
suddenly
started
up
,
and
,
closing
his
eyes
,
placed
his
fingers
upon
the
lids
,
as
though
he
sought
to
imprison
within
his
brain
some
curious
dream
from
which
he
feared
he
might
awake
.
"
it
is
your
best
work
,
basil
,
the
best
thing
you
have
ever
done
,
"
said
lord
henry
,
languidly
.
"
you
must
certainly
send
it
next
year
to
the
grosvenor
.
the
academy
is
too
large
and
too
vulgar
.
whenever
i
have
gone
there
,
there
have
been
either
so
many
people
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
see
the
pictures
,
which
was
dreadful
,
or
so
many
pictures
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
see
the
people
,
which
was
worse
.
the
grosvenor
is
really
the
only
place
.
"
"
i
don
'
t
think
i
shall
send
it
anywhere
,
"
he
answered
,
tossing
his
head
back
in
that
odd
way
that
used
to
make
his
friends
laugh
at
him
at
oxford
.
"
no
:
i
won
'
t
send
it
anywhere
.
"
lord
henry
elevated
his
eyebrows
,
and
looked
at
him
in
amazement
through
the
thin
blue
wreaths
of
smoke
that
curled
up
in
such
fanciful
whorls
from
his
heavy
opium
-
tainted
cigarette
.
"
not
send
it
anywhere
?
my
dear
fellow
,
why
?
have
you
any
reason
?
what
odd
chaps
you
painters
are
!
you
do
anything
in
the
world
to
gain
a
reputation
.
as
soon
as
you
have
one
,
you
seem
to
want
to
throw
it
away
.
it
is
silly
of
you
,
for
there
is
only
one
thing
in
the
world
worse
than
being
talked
about
,
and
that
is
not
being
talked
about
.
a
portrait
like
this
would
set
you
far
above
all
the
young
men
in
england
,
and
make
the
old
men
quite
jealous
,
if
old
men
are
ever
capable
of
any
emotion
.
"
"
i
know
you
will
laugh
at
me
,
"
he
replied
,
"
but
i
really
can
'
t
exhibit
it
.
i
have
put
too
much
of
myself
into
it
.
"
lord
henry
stretched
himself
out
on
the
divan
and
laughed
.
"
yes
,
i
knew
you
would
;
but
it
is
quite
true
,
all
the
same
.
"
"
too
much
of
yourself
in
it
!
upon
my
word
,
basil
,
i
didn
'
t
know
you
were
so
vain
;
and
i
really
can
'
t
see
any
resemblance
between
you
,
with
your
rugged
strong
face
and
your
coal
-
black
hair
,
and
this
young
adonis
,
who
looks
as
if
he
was
made
out
of
ivory
and
rose
-
leaves
.
why
,
my
dear
basil
,
he
is
a
narcissus
,
and
you
-
-
well
,
of
course
you
have
an
intellectual
expression
,
and
all
that
.
but
beauty
,
real
beauty
,
ends
where
an
intellectual
expression
begins
.
intellect
is
in
itself
a
mode
of
exaggeration
,
and
destroys
the
harmony
of
any
face
.
the
moment
one
sits
down
to
think
,
one
becomes
all
nose
,
or
all
forehead
,
or
something
horrid
.
look
at
the
successful
men
in
any
of
the
learned
professions
.
how
perfectly
hideous
they
are
!
except
,
of
course
,
in
the
church
.
but
then
in
the
church
they
don
'
t
think
.
a
bishop
keeps
on
saying
at
the
age
of
eighty
what
he
was
told
to
say
when
he
was
a
boy
of
eighteen
,
and
as
a
natural
consequence
he
always
looks
absolutely
delightful
.
your
mysterious
young
friend
,
whose
name
you
have
never
told
me
,
but
whose
picture
really
fascinates
me
,
never
thinks
.
i
feel
quite
sure
of
that
.
he
is
some
brainless
,
beautiful
creature
,
who
should
be
always
here
in
winter
when
we
have
no
flowers
to
look
at
,
and
always
here
in
summer
when
we
want
something
to
chill
our
intelligence
.
don
'
t
flatter
yourself
,
basil
:
you
are
not
in
the
least
like
him
.
"
"
you
don
'
t
understand
me
,
harry
,
"
answered
the
artist
.
"
of
course
i
am
not
like
him
.
i
know
that
perfectly
well
.
indeed
,
i
should
be
sorry
to
look
like
him
.
you
shrug
your
shoulders
?
i
am
telling
you
the
truth
.
there
is
a
fatality
about
all
physical
and
intellectual
distinction
,
the
sort
of
fatality
that
seems
to
dog
through
history
the
faltering
steps
of
kings
.
it
is
better
not
to
be
different
from
one
'
s
fellows
.
the
ugly
and
the
stupid
have
the
best
of
it
in
this
world
.
they
can
sit
at
their
ease
and
gape
at
the
play
.
if
they
know
nothing
of
victory
,
they
are
at
least
spared
the
knowledge
of
defeat
.
they
live
as
we
all
should
live
,
undisturbed
,
indifferent
,
and
without
disquiet
.
they
neither
bring
ruin
upon
others
,
nor
ever
receive
it
from
alien
hands
.
your
rank
and
wealth
,
harry
;
my
brains
,
such
as
they
are
-
-
my
art
,
whatever
it
may
be
worth
;
dorian
gray
'
s
good
looks
-
-
we
shall
all
suffer
for
what
the
gods
have
given
us
,
suffer
terribly
.
"
"
dorian
gray
?
is
that
his
name
?
"
asked
lord
henry
,
walking
across
the
studio
towards
basil
hallward
.
"
yes
,
that
is
his
name
.
i
didn
'
t
intend
to
tell
it
to
you
.
"
"
but
why
not
?
"
"
oh
,
i
can
'
t
explain
.
when
i
like
people
immensely
i
never
tell
their
names
to
anyone
.
it
is
like
surrendering
a
part
of
them
.
i
have
grown
to
love
secrecy
.
it
seems
to
be
the
one
thing
that
can
make
modern
life
mysterious
or
marvellous
to
us
.
the
commonest
thing
is
delightful
if
one
only
hides
it
.
when
i
leave
town
now
i
never
tell
my
people
where
i
am
going
.
if
i
did
,
i
would
lose
all
my
pleasure
.
it
is
a
silly
habit
,
i
daresay
,
but
somehow
it
seems
to
bring
a
great
deal
of
romance
into
one
'
s
life
.
i
suppose
you
think
me
awfully
foolish
about
it
?
"
"
not
at
all
,
"
answered
lord
henry
,
"
not
at
all
,
my
dear
basil
.
you
seem
to
forget
that
i
am
married
,
and
the
one
charm
of
marriage
is
that
it
makes
a
life
of
deception
absolutely
necessary
for
both
parties
.
i
never
know
where
my
wife
is
,
and
my
wife
never
knows
what
i
am
doing
.
when
we
meet
-
-
we
do
meet
occasionally
,
when
we
dine
out
together
,
or
go
down
to
the
duke
'
s
-
-
we
tell
each
other
the
most
absurd
stories
with
the
most
serious
faces
.
my
wife
is
very
good
at
it
-
-
much
better
,
in
fact
,
than
i
am
.
she
never
gets
confused
over
her
dates
,
and
i
always
do
.
but
when
she
does
find
me
out
,
she
makes
no
row
at
all
.
i
sometimes
wish
she
would
;
but
she
merely
laughs
at
me
.
"
"
i
hate
the
way
you
talk
about
your
married
life
,
harry
,
"
said
basil
hallward
,
strolling
towards
the
door
that
led
into
the
garden
.
"
i
believe
that
you
are
really
a
very
good
husband
,
but
that
you
are
thoroughly
ashamed
of
your
own
virtues
.
you
are
an
extraordinary
fellow
.
you
never
say
a
moral
thing
,
and
you
never
do
a
wrong
thing
.
your
cynicism
is
simply
a
pose
.
"
"
being
natural
is
simply
a
pose
,
and
the
most
irritating
pose
i
know
,
"
cried
lord
henry
,
laughing
;
and
the
two
young
men
went
out
into
the
garden
together
,
and
ensconced
themselves
on
a
long
bamboo
seat
that
stood
in
the
shade
of
a
tall
laurel
bush
.
the
sunlight
slipped
over
the
polished
leaves
.
in
the
grass
,
white
daisies
were
tremulous
.
after
a
pause
,
lord
henry
pulled
out
his
watch
.
"
i
am
afraid
i
must
be
going
,
basil
,
"
he
murmured
,
"
and
before
i
go
,
i
insist
on
your
answering
a
question
i
put
to
you
some
time
ago
.
"
"
what
is
that
?
"
said
the
painter
,
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
.
"
you
know
quite
well
.
"
"
i
do
not
,
harry
.
"
"
well
,
i
will
tell
you
what
it
is
.
i
want
you
to
explain
to
me
why
you
won
'
t
exhibit
dorian
gray
'
s
picture
.
i
want
the
real
reason
.
"
"
i
told
you
the
real
reason
.
"
"
no
,
you
did
not
.
you
said
it
was
because
there
was
too
much
of
yourself
in
it
.
now
,
that
is
childish
.
"
"
harry
,
"
said
basil
hallward
,
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
,
"
every
portrait
that
is
painted
with
feeling
is
a
portrait
of
the
artist
,
not
of
the
sitter
.
the
sitter
is
merely
the
accident
,
the
occasion
.
it
is
not
he
who
is
revealed
by
the
painter
;
it
is
rather
the
painter
who
,
on
the
coloured
canvas
,
reveals
himself
.
the
reason
i
will
not
exhibit
this
picture
is
that
i
am
afraid
that
i
have
shown
in
it
the
secret
of
my
own
soul
.
"
lord
henry
laughed
.
"
and
what
is
that
?
"
he
asked
.
"
i
will
tell
you
,
"
said
hallward
;
but
an
expression
of
perplexity
came
over
his
face
.
"
i
am
all
expectation
,
basil
,
"
continued
his
companion
,
glancing
at
him
.
"
oh
,
there
is
really
very
little
to
tell
,
harry
,
"
answered
the
painter
;
"
and
i
am
afraid
you
will
hardly
understand
it
.
perhaps
you
will
hardly
believe
it
.
"
lord
henry
smiled
,
and
,
leaning
down
,
plucked
a
pink
-
petalled
daisy
from
the
grass
,
and
examined
it
.
"
i
am
quite
sure
i
shall
understand
it
,
"
he
replied
,
gazing
intently
at
the
little
golden
white
-
feathered
disk
,
"
and
as
for
believing
things
,
i
can
believe
anything
,
provided
that
it
is
quite
incredible
.
"
the
wind
shook
some
blossoms
from
the
trees
,
and
the
heavy
lilac
-
blooms
,
with
their
clustering
stars
,
moved
to
and
fro
in
the
languid
air
.
a
grasshopper
began
to
chirrup
by
the
wall
,
and
like
a
blue
thread
a
long
thin
dragon
-
fly
floated
past
on
its
brown
gauze
wings
.
lord
henry
felt
as
if
he
could
hear
basil
hallward
'
s
heart
beating
,
and
wondered
what
was
coming
.
"
the
story
is
simply
this
,
"
said
the
painter
after
some
time
.
"
two
months
ago
i
went
to
a
crush
at
lady
brandon
'
s
.
you
know
we
poor
artists
have
to
show
ourselves
in
society
from
time
to
time
,
just
to
remind
the
public
that
we
are
not
savages
.
with
an
evening
coat
and
a
white
tie
,
as
you
told
me
once
,
anybody
,
even
a
stockbroker
,
can
gain
a
reputation
for
being
civilised
.
well
,
after
i
had
been
in
the
room
about
ten
minutes
,
talking
to
huge
over
-
dressed
dowagers
and
tedious
academicians
,
i
suddenly
became
conscious
that
someone
was
looking
at
me
.
i
turned
halfway
round
,
and
saw
dorian
gray
for
the
first
time
.
when
our
eyes
met
,
i
felt
that
i
was
growing
pale
.
a
curious
sensation
of
terror
came
over
me
.
i
knew
that
i
had
come
face
to
face
with
someone
whose
mere
personality
was
so
fascinating
that
,
if
i
allowed
it
to
do
so
,
it
would
absorb
my
whole
nature
,
my
whole
soul
,
my
very
art
itself
.
i
did
not
want
any
external
influence
in
my
life
.
you
know
yourself
,
harry
,
how
independent
i
am
by
nature
.
i
have
always
been
my
own
master
;
had
at
least
always
been
so
,
till
i
met
dorian
gray
.
then
-
-
-
-
but
i
don
'
t
know
how
to
explain
it
to
you
.
something
seemed
to
tell
me
that
i
was
on
the
verge
of
a
terrible
crisis
in
my
life
.
i
had
a
strange
feeling
that
fate
had
in
store
for
me
exquisite
joys
and
exquisite
sorrows
.
i
grew
afraid
,
and
turned
to
quit
the
room
.
it
was
not
conscience
that
made
me
do
so
;
it
was
a
sort
of
cowardice
.
i
take
no
credit
to
myself
for
trying
to
escape
.
"
"
conscience
and
cowardice
are
really
the
same
things
,
basil
.
conscience
is
the
trade
-
name
of
the
firm
.
that
is
all
.
"
"
i
don
'
t
believe
that
,
harry
,
and
i
don
'
t
believe
you
do
either
.
however
,
whatever
was
my
motive
-
-
and
it
may
have
been
pride
,
for
i
used
to
be
very
proud
-
-
i
certainly
struggled
to
the
door
.
there
,
of
course
,
i
stumbled
against
lady
brandon
.
'
you
are
not
going
to
run
away
so
soon
,
mr
.
hallward
?
'
she
screamed
out
.
you
know
her
curiously
shrill
voice
?
"
"
yes
;
she
is
a
peacock
in
everything
but
beauty
,
"
said
lord
henry
,
pulling
the
daisy
to
bits
with
his
long
,
nervous
fingers
.
"
i
could
not
get
rid
of
her
.
she
brought
me
up
to
royalties
,
and
people
with
stars
and
garters
,
and
elderly
ladles
with
gigantic
tiaras
and
parrot
noses
.
she
spoke
of
me
as
her
dearest
friend
.
i
had
only
met
her
once
before
,
but
she
took
it
into
her
head
to
lionise
me
.
i
believe
some
picture
of
mine
had
made
a
great
success
at
the
time
,
at
least
had
been
chattered
about
in
the
penny
newspapers
,
which
is
the
nineteenth
-
century
standard
of
immortality
.
suddenly
i
found
myself
face
to
face
with
the
young
man
whose
personality
had
so
strangely
stirred
me
.
we
were
quite
close
,
almost
touching
.
our
eyes
met
again
.
it
was
reckless
of
me
,
but
i
asked
lady
brandon
to
introduce
me
to
him
.
perhaps
it
was
not
so
reckless
,
after
all
.
it
was
simply
inevitable
.
we
would
have
spoken
to
each
other
without
any
introduction
.
i
am
sure
of
that
.
dorian
told
me
so
afterwards
.
he
,
too
,
felt
that
we
were
destined
to
know
each
other
.
"
"
and
how
did
lady
brandon
describe
this
wonderful
young
man
?
"
asked
his
companion
.
"
i
know
she
goes
in
for
giving
a
rapid
_
pr
cis
_
of
all
her
guests
.
i
remember
her
bringing
me
up
to
a
truculent
and
red
-
faced
old
gentleman
covered
all
over
with
orders
and
ribbons
,
and
hissing
into
my
ear
,
in
a
tragic
whisper
which
must
have
been
perfectly
audible
to
everybody
in
the
room
,
the
most
astounding
details
.
i
simply
fled
.
i
like
to
find
out
people
for
myself
.
but
lady
brandon
treats
her
guests
exactly
as
an
auctioneer
treats
his
goods
.
she
either
explains
them
entirely
away
,
or
tells
one
everything
about
them
except
what
one
wants
to
know
.
"
"
poor
lady
brandon
!
you
are
hard
on
her
,
harry
!
"
said
hallward
,
listlessly
.
"
my
dear
fellow
,
she
tried
to
found
a
_
salon
_
,
and
only
succeeded
in
opening
a
restaurant
.
how
could
i
admire
her
?
but
tell
me
,
what
did
she
say
about
mr
.
dorian
gray
?
"
"
oh
,
something
like
,
'
charming
boy
-
-
poor
dear
mother
and
i
absolutely
inseparable
.
quite
forget
what
he
does
-
-
afraid
he
-
-
doesn
'
t
do
anything
-
-
oh
,
yes
,
plays
the
piano
-
-
or
is
it
the
violin
,
dear
mr
.
gray
?
'
neither
of
us
could
help
laughing
,
and
we
became
friends
at
once
.
"
"
laughter
is
not
at
all
a
bad
beginning
for
a
friendship
,
and
it
is
far
the
best
ending
for
one
,
"
said
the
young
lord
,
plucking
another
daisy
.
hallward
shook
his
head
.
"
you
don
'
t
understand
what
friendship
is
,
harry
,
"
he
murmured
-
-
"
or
what
enmity
is
,
for
that
matter
.
you
like
everyone
;
that
is
to
say
,
you
are
indifferent
to
everyone
.
"
"
how
horribly
unjust
of
you
!
"
cried
lord
henry
,
tilting
his
hat
back
,
and
looking
up
at
the
little
clouds
that
,
like
ravelled
skeins
of
glossy
white
silk
,
were
drifting
across
the
hollowed
turquoise
of
the
summer
sky
.
"
yes
;
horribly
unjust
of
you
.
i
make
a
great
difference
between
people
.
i
choose
my
friends
for
their
good
looks
,
my
acquaintances
for
their
good
characters
,
and
my
enemies
for
their
good
intellects
.
a
man
cannot
be
too
careful
in
the
choice
of
his
enemies
.
i
have
not
got
one
who
is
a
fool
.
they
are
all
men
of
some
intellectual
power
,
and
consequently
they
all
appreciate
me
.
is
that
very
vain
of
me
?
i
think
it
is
rather
vain
.
"
"
i
should
think
it
was
,
harry
.
but
according
to
your
category
i
must
be
merely
an
acquaintance
.
"
"
my
dear
old
basil
,
you
are
much
more
than
an
acquaintance
.
"
"
and
much
less
than
a
friend
.
a
sort
of
brother
,
i
suppose
?
"
"
oh
,
brothers
!
i
don
'
t
care
for
brothers
.
my
elder
brother
won
'
t
die
,
and
my
younger
brothers
seem
never
to
do
anything
else
.
"
"
harry
!
"
exclaimed
hallward
,
frowning
.
"
my
dear
fellow
,
i
am
not
quite
serious
.
but
i
can
'
t
help
detesting
my
relations
.
i
suppose
it
comes
from
the
fact
that
none
of
us
can
stand
other
people
having
the
same
faults
as
ourselves
.
i
quite
sympathise
with
the
rage
of
the
english
democracy
against
what
they
call
the
vices
of
the
upper
orders
.
the
masses
feel
that
drunkenness
,
stupidity
,
and
immorality
should
be
their
own
special
property
,
and
that
if
anyone
of
us
makes
an
ass
of
himself
he
is
poaching
on
their
preserves
.
when
poor
southwark
got
into
the
divorce
court
,
their
indignation
was
quite
magnificent
.
and
yet
i
don
'
t
suppose
that
ten
per
cent
.
of
the
proletariat
live
correctly
.
"
"
i
don
'
t
agree
with
a
single
word
that
you
have
said
,
and
,
what
is
more
,
harry
,
i
feel
sure
you
don
'
t
either
.
"
lord
henry
stroked
his
pointed
brown
beard
,
and
tapped
the
toe
of
his
patent
-
leather
boot
with
a
tasselled
ebony
cane
.
"
how
english
you
are
,
basil
!
that
is
the
second
time
you
have
made
that
observation
.
if
one
puts
forward
an
idea
to
a
true
englishman
-
-
always
a
rash
thing
to
do
-
-
he
never
dreams
of
considering
whether
the
idea
is
right
or
wrong
.
the
only
thing
he
considers
of
any
importance
is
whether
one
believes
it
oneself
.
now
,
the
value
of
an
idea
has
nothing
whatsoever
to
do
with
the
sincerity
of
the
man
who
expresses
it
.
indeed
,
the
probabilities
are
that
the
more
insincere
the
man
is
,
the
more
purely
intellectual
will
the
idea
be
,
as
in
that
case
it
will
not
be
coloured
by
either
his
wants
,
his
desires
,
or
his
prejudices
.
however
,
i
don
'
t
propose
to
discuss
politics
,
sociology
,
or
metaphysics
with
you
.
i
like
persons
better
than
principles
,
and
i
like
persons
with
no
principles
better
than
anything
else
in
the
world
.
tell
me
more
about
mr
.
dorian
gray
.
how
often
do
you
see
him
?
"
"
every
day
.
i
couldn
'
t
be
happy
if
i
didn
'
t
see
him
every
day
.
he
is
absolutely
necessary
to
me
.
"
"
how
extraordinary
!
i
thought
you
would
never
care
for
anything
but
your
art
.
"
"
he
is
all
my
art
to
me
now
,
"
said
the
painter
,
gravely
.
"
i
sometimes
think
,
harry
,
that
there
are
only
two
eras
of
any
importance
in
the
world
'
s
history
.
the
first
is
the
appearance
of
a
new
medium
for
art
,
and
the
second
is
the
appearance
of
a
new
personality
for
art
also
.
what
the
invention
of
oil
-
painting
was
to
the
venetians
,
the
face
of
antinoüs
was
to
late
greek
sculpture
,
and
the
face
of
dorian
gray
will
some
day
be
to
me
.
it
is
not
merely
that
i
paint
from
him
,
draw
from
him
,
sketch
from
him
.
of
course
i
have
done
all
that
.
but
he
is
much
more
to
me
than
a
model
or
a
sitter
.
i
won
'
t
tell
you
that
i
am
dissatisfied
with
what
i
have
done
of
him
,
or
that
his
beauty
is
such
that
art
cannot
express
it
.
there
is
nothing
that
art
cannot
express
,
and
i
know
that
the
work
i
have
done
,
since
i
met
dorian
gray
,
is
good
work
,
is
the
best
work
of
my
life
.
but
in
some
curious
way
-
-
i
wonder
will
you
understand
me
?
-
-
his
personality
has
suggested
to
me
an
entirely
new
manner
in
art
,
an
entirely
new
mode
of
style
.
i
see
things
differently
,
i
think
of
them
differently
.
i
can
now
recreate
life
in
a
way
that
was
hidden
from
me
,
before
.
'
a
dream
of
form
in
days
of
thought
:
'
-
-
who
is
it
who
says
that
?
i
forget
;
but
it
is
what
dorian
gray
has
been
to
me
.
the
merely
visible
presence
of
this
lad
-
-
for
he
seems
to
me
little
more
than
a
lad
,
though
he
is
really
over
twenty
-
-
his
merely
visible
presence
-
-
ah
!
i
wonder
can
you
realise
all
that
that
means
?
unconsciously
he
defines
for
me
the
lines
of
a
fresh
school
,
a
school
that
is
to
have
in
it
all
the
passion
of
the
romantic
spirit
,
all
the
perfection
of
the
spirit
that
is
greek
.
the
harmony
of
soul
and
body
-
-
how
much
that
is
!
we
in
our
madness
have
separated
the
two
,
and
have
invented
a
realism
that
is
vulgar
,
an
ideality
that
is
void
.
harry
!
if
you
only
knew
what
dorian
gray
is
to
me
!
you
remember
that
landscape
of
mine
,
for
which
agnew
offered
me
such
a
huge
price
,
but
which
i
would
not
part
with
?
it
is
one
of
the
best
things
i
have
ever
done
.
and
why
is
it
so
?
because
,
while
i
was
painting
it
,
dorian
gray
sat
beside
me
.
some
subtle
influence
passed
from
him
to
me
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
saw
in
the
plain
woodland
the
wonder
i
had
always
looked
for
,
and
always
missed
.
"
"
basil
,
this
is
extraordinary
!
i
must
see
dorian
gray
.
"
hallward
got
up
from
the
seat
,
and
walked
up
and
down
the
garden
.
after
some
time
he
came
back
.
"
harry
,
"
he
said
,
"
dorian
gray
is
to
me
simply
a
motive
in
art
.
you
might
see
nothing
in
him
.
i
see
everything
in
him
.
he
is
never
more
present
in
my
work
than
when
no
image
of
him
is
there
.
he
is
a
suggestion
,
as
i
have
said
,
of
a
new
manner
.
i
find
him
in
the
curves
of
certain
lines
,
in
the
loveliness
and
subtleties
of
certain
colours
.
that
is
all
.
"
"
then
why
won
'
t
you
exhibit
his
portrait
?
"
asked
lord
henry
.
"
because
,
without
intending
it
,
i
have
put
into
it
some
expression
of
all
this
curious
artistic
idolatry
,
of
which
,
of
course
,
i
have
never
cared
to
speak
to
him
.
he
knows
nothing
about
it
.
he
shall
never
know
anything
about
it
.
but
the
world
might
guess
it
;
and
i
will
not
bare
my
soul
to
their
shallow
prying
eyes
.
my
heart
shall
never
be
put
under
their
microscope
.
there
is
too
much
of
myself
in
the
thing
,
harry
-
-
too
much
of
myself
!
"
"
poets
are
not
so
scrupulous
as
you
are
.
they
know
how
useful
passion
is
for
publication
.
nowadays
a
broken
heart
will
run
to
many
editions
.
"
"
i
hate
them
for
it
,
"
cried
hallward
.
"
an
artist
should
create
beautiful
things
,
but
should
put
nothing
of
his
own
life
into
them
.
we
live
in
an
age
when
men
treat
art
as
if
it
were
meant
to
be
a
form
of
autobiography
.
we
have
lost
the
abstract
sense
of
beauty
.
some
day
i
will
show
the
world
what
it
is
;
and
for
that
reason
the
world
shall
never
see
my
portrait
of
dorian
gray
.
"
"
i
think
you
are
wrong
,
basil
,
but
i
won
'
t
argue
with
you
.
it
is
only
the
intellectually
lost
who
ever
argue
.
tell
me
,
is
dorian
gray
very
fond
of
you
?
"
the
painter
considered
for
a
few
moments
.
"
he
likes
me
,
"
he
answered
,
after
a
pause
;
"
i
know
he
likes
me
.
of
course
i
flatter
him
dreadfully
.
i
find
a
strange
pleasure
in
saying
things
to
him
that
i
know
i
shall
be
sorry
for
having
said
.
as
a
rule
,
he
is
charming
to
me
,
and
we
sit
in
the
studio
and
talk
of
a
thousand
things
.
now
and
then
,
however
,
he
is
horribly
thoughtless
,
and
seems
to
take
a
real
delight
in
giving
me
pain
.
then
i
feel
,
harry
,
that
i
have
given
away
my
whole
soul
to
someone
who
treats
it
as
if
it
were
a
flower
to
put
in
his
coat
,
a
bit
of
decoration
to
charm
his
vanity
,
an
ornament
for
a
summer
'
s
day
.
"
"
days
in
summer
,
basil
,
are
apt
to
linger
,
"
murmured
lord
henry
.
"
perhaps
you
will
tire
sooner
than
he
will
.
it
is
a
sad
thing
to
think
of
,
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
genius
lasts
longer
than
beauty
.
that
accounts
for
the
fact
that
we
all
take
such
pains
to
over
-
educate
ourselves
.
in
the
wild
struggle
for
existence
,
we
want
to
have
something
that
endures
,
and
so
we
fill
our
minds
with
rubbish
and
facts
,
in
the
silly
hope
of
keeping
our
place
.
the
thoroughly
well
-
informed
man
-
-
that
is
the
modern
ideal
.
and
the
mind
of
the
thoroughly
well
-
informed
man
is
a
dreadful
thing
.
it
is
like
a
bric
-
-
brac
shop
,
all
monsters
and
dust
,
with
everything
priced
above
its
proper
value
.
i
think
you
will
tire
first
,
all
the
same
.
some
day
you
will
look
at
your
friend
,
and
he
will
seem
to
you
to
be
a
little
out
of
drawing
,
or
you
won
'
t
like
his
tone
of
colour
,
or
something
.
you
will
bitterly
reproach
him
in
your
own
heart
,
and
seriously
think
that
he
has
behaved
very
badly
to
you
.
the
next
time
he
calls
,
you
will
be
perfectly
cold
and
indifferent
.
it
will
be
a
great
pity
,
for
it
will
alter
you
.
what
you
have
told
me
is
quite
a
romance
,
a
romance
of
art
one
might
call
it
,
and
the
worst
of
having
a
romance
of
any
kind
is
that
it
leaves
one
so
unromantic
.
"
"
harry
,
don
'
t
talk
like
that

as
long
as
i
live

the
personality
of
dorian
gray
will
dominate
me

you
can
'
t
feel
what
i

you
change
too
often

"
"
ah
,
my
dear
basil
,
that
is
exactly
why
i
can
feel
it
.
those
who
are
faithful
know
only
the
trivial
side
of
love
:
it
is
the
faithless
who
know
love
'
s
tragedies

and
lord
henry
struck
a
light
on
a
dainty
silver
case

began
to
smoke
a
cigarette
with
a
self
-
conscious
and
satisfied
air
,
as
if
he
had
summed
up
the
world
in
a
phrase
.
there
was
a
rustle
of
chirruping
sparrows
in
the
green
lacquer
leaves
of
the
ivy
,
and
the
blue
cloud
-
shadows
chased
themselves
across
the
grass
like
swallows
.
how
pleasant
it
was
in
the
garden
!
and
how
delightful
other
people
'
s
emotions
were
!
-
-
much
more
delightful
than
their
ideas
,
it
seemed
to
him
.
one
'
s
own
soul
,
and
the
passions
of
one
'
s
friends
-
-
those
were
the
fascinating
things
in
life
.
he
pictured
to
himself
with
silent
amusement
the
tedious
luncheon
that
he
had
missed
by
staying
so
long
with
basil
hallward
.
had
he
gone
to
his
aunt
'
s
he
would
have
been
sure
to
have
met
lord
goodbody
there
,
and
the
whole
conversation
would
have
been
about
the
feeding
of
the
poor
,
and
the
necessity
for
model
lodging
-
houses
.
each
class
would
have
preached
the
importance
of
those
virtues
,
for
whose
exercise
there
was
no
necessity
in
their
own
lives
.
the
rich
would
have
spoken
on
the
value
of
thrift
,
and
the
idle
grown
eloquent
over
the
dignity
of
labour
.
it
was
charming
to
have
escaped
all
that
!
as
he
thought
of
his
aunt
,
an
idea
seemed
to
strike
him
.
he
turned
to
hallward
,
and
said
,
"
my
dear
fellow
,
i
have
just
remembered
.
"
"
remembered
what
,
harry
?
"
"
where
i
heard
the
name
of
dorian
gray
.
"
"
where
was
it
?
"
asked
hallward
,
with
a
slight
frown
.
"
don
'
t
look
so
angry
,
basil
.
it
was
at
my
aunt
,
lady
agatha
'
s
.
she
told
me
she
had
discovered
a
wonderful
young
man
,
who
was
going
to
help
her
in
the
east
end
,
and
that
his
name
was
dorian
gray
.
i
am
bound
to
state
that
she
never
told
me
he
was
good
-
looking
.
women
have
no
appreciation
of
good
looks
;
at
least
,
good
women
have
not
.
she
said
that
he
was
very
earnest
,
and
had
a
beautiful
nature
.
i
at
once
pictured
to
myself
a
creature
with
spectacles
and
lank
hair
,
horribly
freckled
,
and
tramping
about
on
huge
feet
.
i
wish
i
had
known
it
was
your
friend
.
"
"
i
am
very
glad
you
didn
'
t
,
harry
.
"
"
why
?
"
"
i
don
'
t
want
you
to
meet
him
.
"
"
you
don
'
t
want
me
to
meet
him
?
"
"
no
.
"
"
mr
.
dorian
gray
is
in
the
studio
,
sir
,
"
said
the
butler
,
coming
into
the
garden
.
"
you
must
introduce
me
now
,
"
cried
lord
henry
,
laughing
.
the
painter
turned
to
his
servant
,
who
stood
blinking
in
the
sunlight
.
"
ask
mr
.
gray
to
wait
,
parker
:
i
shall
be
in
in
a
few
moments
.
"
the
man
bowed
,
and
went
up
the
walk
.
then
he
looked
at
lord
henry
.
"
dorian
gray
is
my
dearest
friend
,
"
he
said
.
"
he
has
a
simple
and
a
beautiful
nature
.
your
aunt
was
quite
right
in
what
she
said
of
him
.
don
'
t
spoil
him
.
don
'
t
try
to
influence
him
.
your
influence
would
be
bad
.
the
world
is
wide
,
and
has
many
marvellous
people
in
it
.
don
'
t
take
away
from
me
the
one
person
who
gives
to
my
art
whatever
charm
it
possesses
;
my
life
as
an
artist
depends
on
him
.
mind
,
harry
,
i
trust
you
.
"
he
spoke
very
slowly
,
and
the
words
seemed
wrung
out
of
him
almost
against
his
will
.
"
what
nonsense
you
talk
!
"
said
lord
henry
,
smiling
,
and
,
taking
hallward
by
the
arm
,
he
almost
led
him
into
the
house
.
chapter
ii
as
they
entered
they
saw
dorian
gray
.
he
was
seated
at
the
piano
,
with
his
back
to
them
,
turning
over
the
pages
of
a
volume
of
schumann
'
s
"
forest
scenes
.
"
"
you
must
lend
me
these
,
basil
,
"
he
cried
.
"
i
want
to
learn
them
.
they
are
perfectly
charming
.
"
"
that
entirely
depends
on
how
you
sit
to
-
day
,
dorian
.
"
"
oh
,
i
am
tired
of
sitting
,
and
i
don
'
t
want
a
life
-
sized
portrait
of
myself
,
"
answered
the
lad
,
swinging
round
on
the
music
-
stool
,
in
a
wilful
,
petulant
manner
.
when
he
caught
sight
of
lord
henry
,
a
faint
blush
coloured
his
cheeks
for
a
moment
,
and
he
started
up
.
"
i
beg
your
pardon
,
basil
,
but
i
didn
'
t
know
you
had
anyone
with
you
.
"
"
this
is
lord
henry
wotton
,
dorian
,
an
old
oxford
friend
of
mine
.
i
have
just
been
telling
him
what
a
capital
sitter
you
were
,
and
now
you
have
spoiled
everything
.
"
"
you
have
not
spoiled
my
pleasure
in
meeting
you
,
mr
.
gray
,
"
said
lord
henry
,
stepping
forward
and
extending
his
hand
.
"
my
aunt
has
often
spoken
to
me
about
you
.
you
are
one
of
her
favourites
,
and
,
i
am
afraid
,
one
of
her
victims
also
.
"
"
i
am
in
lady
agatha
'
s
black
books
at
present
,
"
answered
dorian
,
with
a
funny
look
of
penitence
.
"
i
promised
to
go
to
a
club
in
whitechapel
with
her
last
tuesday
,
and
i
really
forgot
all
about
it
.
we
were
to
have
played
a
duet
together
-
-
three
duets
,
i
believe
.
i
don
'
t
know
what
she
will
say
to
me
.
i
am
far
too
frightened
to
call
.
"
"
oh
,
i
will
make
your
peace
with
my
aunt
.
she
is
quite
devoted
to
you
.
and
i
don
'
t
think
it
really
matters
about
your
not
being
there
.
the
audience
probably
thought
it
was
a
duet
.
when
aunt
agatha
sits
down
to
the
piano
she
makes
quite
enough
noise
for
two
people
.
"
"
that
is
very
horrid
to
her
,
and
not
very
nice
to
me
,
"
answered
dorian
,
laughing
.
lord
henry
looked
at
him
.
yes
,
he
was
certainly
wonderfully
handsome
,
with
his
finely
-
curved
scarlet
lips
,
his
frank
blue
eyes
,
his
crisp
gold
hair
.
there
was
something
in
his
face
that
made
one
trust
him
at
once
.
all
the
candour
of
youth
was
there
,
as
well
as
all
youth
'
s
passionate
purity
.
one
felt
that
he
had
kept
himself
unspotted
from
the
world
.
no
wonder
basil
hallward
worshipped
him
.
"
you
are
too
charming
to
go
in
for
philanthropy
,
mr
.
gray
-
-
far
too
charming
.
"
and
lord
henry
flung
himself
down
on
the
divan
,
and
opened
his
cigarette
-
case
.
the
painter
had
been
busy
mixing
his
colours
and
getting
his
brushes
ready
.
he
was
looking
worried
,
and
when
he
heard
lord
henry
'
s
last
remark
he
glanced
at
him
,
hesitated
for
a
moment
,
and
then
said
,
"
harry
,
i
want
to
finish
this
picture
to
-
day
.
would
you
think
it
awfully
rude
of
me
if
i
asked
you
to
go
away
?
"
lord
henry
smiled
,
and
looked
at
dorian
gray
.
"
am
i
to
go
,
mr
.
gray
?
"
he
asked
.
"
oh
,
please
don
'
t
,
lord
henry
.
i
see
that
basil
is
in
one
of
his
sulky
moods
;
and
i
can
'
t
bear
him
when
he
sulks
.
besides
,
i
want
you
to
tell
me
why
i
should
not
go
in
for
philanthropy
.
"
"
i
don
'
t
know
that
i
shall
tell
you
that
,
mr
.
gray
.
it
is
so
tedious
a
subject
that
one
would
have
to
talk
seriously
about
it
.
but
i
certainly
shall
not
run
away
,
now
that
you
have
asked
me
to
stop
.
you
don
'
t
really
mind
,
basil
,
do
you
?
you
have
often
told
me
that
you
liked
your
sitters
to
have
someone
to
chat
to
.
"
hallward
bit
his
lip
.
"
if
dorian
wishes
it
,
of
course
you
must
stay
.
dorian
'
s
whims
are
laws
to
everybody
,
except
himself
.
"
lord
henry
took
up
his
hat
and
gloves
.
"
you
are
very
pressing
,
basil
,
but
i
am
afraid
i
must
go
.
i
have
promised
to
meet
a
man
at
the
orleans
.
good
-
bye
,
mr
.
gray
.
come
and
see
me
some
afternoon
in
curzon
street
.
i
am
nearly
always
at
home
at
five
o
'
clock
.
write
to
me
when
you
are
coming
.
i
should
be
sorry
to
miss
you
.
"
"
basil
,
"
cried
dorian
gray
,
"
if
lord
henry
wotton
goes
i
shall
go
too
.
you
never
open
your
lips
while
you
are
painting
,
and
it
is
horribly
dull
standing
on
a
platform
and
trying
to
look
pleasant
.
ask
him
to
stay
.
i
insist
upon
it
.
"
"
stay
,
harry
,
to
oblige
dorian
,
and
to
oblige
me
,
"
said
hallward
,
gazing
intently
at
his
picture
.
"
it
is
quite
true
,
i
never
talk
when
i
am
working
,
and
never
listen
either
,
and
it
must
be
dreadfully
tedious
for
my
unfortunate
sitters
.
i
beg
you
to
stay
.
"
"
but
what
about
my
man
at
the
orleans
?
"
the
painter
laughed
.
"
i
don
'
t
think
there
will
be
any
difficulty
about
that
.
sit
down
again
,
harry
.
and
now
,
dorian
,
get
up
on
the
platform
,
and
don
'
t
move
about
too
much
,
or
pay
any
attention
to
what
lord
henry
says
.
he
has
a
very
bad
influence
over
all
his
friends
,
with
the
single
exception
of
myself
.
"
dorian
gray
stepped
up
on
the
dais
,
with
the
air
of
a
young
greek
martyr
,
and
made
a
little
_
moue
_
of
discontent
to
lord
henry
,
to
whom
he
had
rather
taken
a
fancy
.
he
was
so
unlike
basil
.
they
made
a
delightful
contrast
.
and
he
had
such
a
beautiful
voice
.
after
a
few
moments
he
said
to
him
,
"
have
you
really
a
very
bad
influence
,
lord
henry
?
as
bad
as
basil
says
?
"
"
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
good
influence
,
mr
.
gray
.
all
influence
is
immoral
-
-
immoral
from
the
scientific
point
of
view
.
"
"
why
?
"
"
because
to
influence
a
person
is
to
give
him
one
'
s
own
soul
.
he
does
not
think
his
natural
thoughts
,
or
burn
with
his
natural
passions
.
his
virtues
are
not
real
to
him
.
his
sins
,
if
there
are
such
things
as
sins
,
are
borrowed
.
he
becomes
an
echo
of
someone
else
'
s
music
,
an
actor
of
a
part
that
has
not
been
written
for
him
.
the
aim
of
life
is
self
-
development
.
to
realise
one
'
s
nature
perfectly
-
-
that
is
what
each
of
us
is
here
for
.
people
are
afraid
of
themselves
,
nowadays
.
they
have
forgotten
the
highest
of
all
duties
,
the
duty
that
one
owes
to
one
'
s
self
.
of
course
they
are
charitable
.
they
feed
the
hungry
,
and
clothe
the
beggar
.
but
their
own
souls
starve
,
and
are
naked
.
courage
has
gone
out
of
our
race
.
perhaps
we
never
really
had
it
.
the
terror
of
society
,
which
is
the
basis
of
morals
,
the
terror
of
god
,
which
is
the
secret
of
religion
-
-
these
are
the
two
things
that
govern
us
.
and
yet
-
-
-
-
"
"
just
turn
your
head
a
little
more
to
the
right
,
dorian
,
like
a
good
boy
,
"
said
the
painter
,
deep
in
his
work
,
and
conscious
only
that
a
look
had
come
into
the
lad
'
s
face
that
he
had
never
seen
there
before
.
"
and
yet
,
"
continued
lord
henry
,
in
his
low
,
musical
voice
,
and
with
that
graceful
wave
of
the
hand
that
was
always
so
characteristic
of
him
,
and
that
he
had
even
in
his
eton
days
,
"
i
believe
that
if
one
man
were
to
live
out
his
life
fully
and
completely
,
were
to
give
form
to
every
feeling
,
expression
to
every
thought
,
reality
to
every
dream
-
-
i
believe
that
the
world
would
gain
such
a
fresh
impulse
of
joy
that
we
would
forget
all
the
maladies
of
medi
valism
,
and
return
to
the
hellenic
ideal
-
-
to
something
finer
,
richer
,
than
the
hellenic
ideal
,
it
may
be
.
but
the
bravest
man
amongst
us
is
afraid
of
himself
.
the
mutilation
of
the
savage
has
its
tragic
survival
in
the
self
-
denial
that
mars
our
lives
.
we
are
punished
for
our
refusals
.
every
impulse
that
we
strive
to
strangle
broods
in
the
mind
,
and
poisons
us
.
the
body
sins
once
,
and
has
done
with
its
sin
,
for
action
is
a
mode
of
purification
.
nothing
remains
then
but
the
recollection
of
a
pleasure
,
or
the
luxury
of
a
regret
.
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
a
temptation
is
to
yield
to
it
.
resist
it
,
and
your
soul
grows
sick
with
longing
for
the
things
it
has
forbidden
to
itself
,
with
desire
for
what
its
monstrous
laws
have
made
monstrous
and
unlawful
.
it
has
been
said
that
the
great
events
of
the
world
take
place
in
the
brain
.
it
is
in
the
brain
,
and
the
brain
only
,
that
the
great
sins
of
the
world
take
place
also
.
you
,
mr
.
gray
,
you
yourself
,
with
your
rose
-
red
youth
and
your
rose
-
white
boyhood
,
you
have
had
passions
that
have
made
you
afraid
,
thoughts
that
have
filled
you
with
terror
,
day
-
dreams
and
sleeping
dreams
whose
mere
memory
might
stain
your
cheek
with
shame
-
-
-
-
"
"
stop
!
"
faltered
dorian
gray
,
"
stop
!
you
bewilder
me
.
i
don
'
t
know
what
to
say
.
there
is
some
answer
to
you
,
but
i
cannot
find
it
.
don

t
speak

let
me
think

or
,
rather
,
let
me
try
not
to
think

"
for
nearly
ten
minutes
he
stood
there
,
motionless
,
with
parted
lips
,
and
eyes
strangely
bright
.
he
was
dimly
conscious
that
entirely
fresh
influences
were
at
work
within
him
.
yet
they
seemed
to
him
to
have
come
really
from
himself
.
the
few
words
that
basil
'
s
friend
had
said
to
him
-
-
words
spoken
by
chance
,
no
doubt
,
and
with
wilful
paradox
in
them
-
-
had
touched
some
secret
chord
that
had
never
been
touched
before
,
but
that
he
felt
was
now
vibrating
and
throbbing
to
curious
pulses
.
music
had
stirred
him
like
that
.
music
had
troubled
him
many
times
.
but
music
was
not
articulate
.
it
was
not
a
new
world
,
but
rather
another
chaos
,
that
it
created
in
us
.
words
!
mere
words
!
how
terrible
they
were
!
how
clear
,
and
vivid
,
and
cruel
!
one
could
not
escape
from
them
.
and
yet
what
a
subtle
magic
there
was
in
them
!
they
seemed
to
be
able
to
give
a
plastic
form
to
formless
things
,
and
to
have
a
music
of
their
own
as
sweet
as
that
of
viol
or
of
lute
.
mere
words
!
was
there
anything
so
real
as
words
?
yes
;
there
had
been
things
in
his
boyhood
that
he
had
not
understood
.
he
understood
them
now
.
life
suddenly
became
fiery
-
coloured
to
him
.
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
walking
in
fire
.
why
had
he
not
known
it
?
with
his
subtle
smile
,
lord
henry
watched
him
.
he
knew
the
precise
psychological
moment
when
to
say
nothing
.
he
felt
intensely
interested
.
he
was
amazed
at
the
sudden
impression
that
his
words
had
produced
,
and
,
remembering
a
book
that
he
had
read
when
he
was
sixteen
,
a
book
which
had
revealed
to
him
much
that
he
had
not
known
before
,
he
wondered
whether
dorian
gray
was
passing
through
a
similar
experience
.
he
had
merely
shot
an
arrow
into
the
air
.
had
it
hit
the
mark
?
how
fascinating
the
lad
was
!
hallward
painted
away
with
that
marvellous
bold
touch
of
his
,
that
had
the
true
refinement
and
perfect
delicacy
that
in
art
,
at
any
rate
,
comes
only
from
strength
.
he
was
unconscious
of
the
silence
.
"
basil
,
i
am
tired
of
standing
,
"
cried
dorian
gray
,
suddenly
.
"
i
must
go
out
and
sit
in
the
garden
.
the
air
is
stifling
here
.
"
"
my
dear
fellow
,
i
am
so
sorry
.
when
i
am
painting
,
i
can
'
t
think
of
anything
else
.
but
you
never
sat
better
.
you
were
perfectly
still
.
and
i
have
caught
the
effect
i
wanted
-
-
the
half
-
parted
lips
,
and
the
bright
look
in
the
eyes
.
i
don
'
t
know
what
harry
has
been
saying
to
you
,
but
he
has
certainly
made
you
have
the
most
wonderful
expression
.
i
suppose
he
has
been
paying
you
compliments
.
you
mustn
'
t
believe
a
word
that
he
says
.
"
"
he
has
certainly
not
been
paying
me
compliments
.
perhaps
that
is
the
reason
that
i
don
'
t
believe
anything
he
has
told
me
.
"
"
you
know
you
believe
it
all
,
"
said
lord
henry
,
looking
at
him
with
his
dreamy
,
languorous
eyes
.
"
i
will
go
out
to
the
garden
with
you
.
it
is
horribly
hot
in
the
studio
.
basil
,
let
us
have
something
iced
to
drink
,
something
with
strawberries
in
it
.
"
"
certainly
,
harry
.
just
touch
the
bell
,
and
when
parker
comes
i
will
tell
him
what
you
want
.
i
have
got
to
work
up
this
background
,
so
i
will
join
you
later
on
.
don
'
t
keep
dorian
too
long
.
i
have
never
been
in
better
form
for
painting
than
i
am
to
-
day
.
this
is
going
to
be
my
masterpiece
.
it
is
my
masterpiece
as
it
stands
.
"
lord
henry
went
out
to
the
garden
,
and
found
dorian
gray
burying
his
face
in
the
great
cool
lilac
-
blossoms
,
feverishly
drinking
in
their
perfume
as
if
it
had
been
wine
.
he
came
close
to
him
,
and
put
his
hand
upon
his
shoulder
.
"
you
are
quite
right
to
do
that
,
"
he
murmured
.
"
nothing
can
cure
the
soul
but
the
senses
,
just
as
nothing
can
cure
the
senses
but
the
soul
.
"
the
lad
started
and
drew
back
.
he
was
bareheaded
,
and
the
leaves
had
tossed
his
rebellious
curls
and
tangled
all
their
gilded
threads
.
there
was
a
look
of
fear
in
his
eyes
,
such
as
people
have
when
they
are
suddenly
awakened
.
his
finely
-
chiselled
nostrils
quivered
,
and
some
hidden
nerve
shook
the
scarlet
of
his
lips
and
left
them
trembling
.
"
yes
,
"
continued
lord
henry
,
"
that
is
one
of
the
great
secrets
of
life
-
-
to
cure
the
soul
by
means
of
the
senses
,
and
the
senses
by
means
of
the
soul
.
you
are
a
wonderful
creation
.
you
know
more
than
you
think
you
know
,
just
as
you
know
less
than
you
want
to
know
.
"
dorian
gray
frowned
and
turned
his
head
away
.
he
could
not
help
liking
the
tall
,
graceful
young
man
who
was
standing
by
him
.
his
romantic
olive
-
coloured
face
and
worn
expression
interested
him
.
there
was
something
in
his
low
,
languid
voice
that
was
absolutely
fascinating
.
his
cool
,
white
,
flower
-
like
hands
,
even
,
had
a
curious
charm
.
they
moved
,
as
he
spoke
,
like
music
,
and
seemed
to
have
a
language
of
their
own
.
but
he
felt
afraid
of
him
,
and
ashamed
of
being
afraid
.
why
had
it
been
left
for
a
stranger
to
reveal
him
to
himself
?
he
had
known
basil
hallward
for
months
,
but
the
friendship
between
them
had
never
altered
him
.
suddenly
there
had
come
someone
across
his
life
who
seemed
to
have
disclosed
to
him
life
'
s
mystery
.
and
,
yet
,
what
was
there
to
be
afraid
of
?
he
was
not
a
schoolboy
or
a
girl
.
it
was
absurd
to
be
frightened
.
"
let
us
go
and
sit
in
the
shade
,
"
said
lord
henry
.
"
parker
has
brought
out
the
drinks
,
and
if
you
stay
any
longer
in
this
glare
you
will
be
quite
spoiled
,
and
basil
will
never
paint
you
again
.
you
really
must
not
allow
yourself
to
become
sunburnt
.
it
would
be
unbecoming
.
"
"
what
can
it
matter
?
"
cried
dorian
gray
,
laughing
,
as
he
sat
down
on
the
seat
at
the
end
of
the
garden
.
"
it
should
matter
everything
to
you
,
mr
.
gray
.
"
"
why
?
"
"
because
you
have
the
most
marvellous
youth
,
and
youth
is
the
one
thing
worth
having
.
"
"
i
don
'
t
feel
that
,
lord
henry
.
"
"
no
,
you
don
'
t
feel
it
now
.
some
day
,
when
you
are
old
and
wrinkled
and
ugly
,
when
thought
has
seared
your
forehead
with
its
lines
,
and
passion
branded
your
lips
with
its
hideous
fires
,
you
will
feel
it
,
you
will
feel
it
terribly
.
now
,
wherever
you
go
,
you
charm
the
world
.
will
it
always
be
so
?
.
.
.
you
have
a
wonderfully
beautiful
face
,
mr
.
gray
.
don
'
t
frown
.
you
have
.
and
beauty
is
a
form
of
genius
-
-
is
higher
,
indeed
,
than
genius
,
as
it
needs
no
explanation
.
it
is
of
the
great
facts
of
the
world
,
like
sunlight
,
or
spring
-
time
,
or
the
reflection
in
dark
waters
of
that
silver
shell
we
call
the
moon
.
it
cannot
be
questioned
.
it
has
its
divine
right
of
sovereignty
.
it
makes
princes
of
those
who
have
it
.
you
smile
?
ah
!
when
you
have
lost
it
you
won
'
t
smile
.
.
.
.
people
say
sometimes
that
beauty
is
only
superficial
.
that
may
be
so
.
but
at
least
it
is
not
so
superficial
as
thought
is
.
to
me
,
beauty
is
the
wonder
of
wonders
.
it
is
only
shallow
people
who
do
not
judge
by
appearances
.
the
true
mystery
of
the
world
is
the
visible
,
not
the
invisible
.
.
.
.
yes
,
mr
.
gray
,
the
gods
have
been
good
to
you
.
but
what
the
gods
give
they
quickly
take
away
.
you
have
only
a
few
years
in
which
to
live
really
,
perfectly
,
and
fully
.
when
your
youth
goes
,
your
beauty
will
go
with
it
,
and
then
you
will
suddenly
discover
that
there
are
no
triumphs
left
for
you
,
or
have
to
content
yourself
with
those
mean
triumphs
that
the
memory
of
your
past
will
make
more
bitter
than
defeats
.
every
month
as
it
wanes
brings
you
nearer
to
something
dreadful
.
time
is
jealous
of
you
,
and
wars
against
your
lilies
and
your
roses
.
you
will
become
sallow
,
and
hollow
-
cheeked
,
and
dull
-
eyed
.
you
will
suffer
horribly
.
.
.
.
ah
!
realise
your
youth
while
you
have
it
.
don
'
t
squander
the
gold
of
your
days
,
listening
to
the
tedious
,
trying
to
improve
the
hopeless
failure
,
or
giving
away
your
life
to
the
ignorant
,
the
common
,
and
the
vulgar
.
these
are
the
sickly
aims
,
the
false
ideals
,
of
our
age
.
live
!
live
the
wonderful
life
that
is
in
you
!
let
nothing
be
lost
upon
you
.
be
always
searching
for
new
sensations
.
be
afraid
of
nothing
.
.
.
.
a
new
hedonism
-
-
that
is
what
our
century
wants
.
you
might
be
its
visible
symbol
.
with
your
personality
there
is
nothing
you
could
not
do
.
the
world
belongs
to
you
for
a
season
.
.
.
.
the
moment
i
met
you
i
saw
that
you
were
quite
unconscious
of
what
you
really
are
,
of
what
you
really
might
be
.
there
was
so
much
in
you
that
charmed
me
that
i
felt
i
must
tell
you
something
about
yourself
.
i
thought
how
tragic
it
would
be
if
you
were
wasted
.
for
there
is
such
a
little
time
that
your
youth
will
last
-
-
such
a
little
time
.
the
common
hill
-
flowers
wither
,
but
they
blossom
again
.
the
laburnum
will
be
as
yellow
next
june
as
it
is
now
.
in
a
month
there
will
be
purple
stars
on
the
clematis
,
and
year
after
year
the
green
night
of
its
leaves
will
hold
its
purple
stars
.
but
we
never
get
back
our
youth
.
the
pulse
of
joy
that
beats
in
us
at
twenty
,
becomes
sluggish
.
our
limbs
fail
,
our
senses
rot
.
we
degenerate
into
hideous
puppets
,
haunted
by
the
memory
of
the
passions
of
which
we
were
too
much
afraid
,
and
the
exquisite
temptations
that
we
had
not
the
courage
to
yield
to
.
youth
!
youth
!
there
is
absolutely
nothing
in
the
world
but
youth
!
"
dorian
gray
listened
,
open
-
eyed
and
wondering
.
the
spray
of
lilac
fell
from
his
hand
upon
the
gravel
.
a
furry
bee
came
and
buzzed
round
it
for
a
moment
.
then
it
began
to
scramble
all
over
the
oval
stellated
globe
of
the
tiny
blossoms
.
he
watched
it
with
that
strange
interest
in
trivial
things
that
we
try
to
develop
when
things
of
high
import
make
us
afraid
,
or
when
we
are
stirred
by
some
new
emotion
for
which
we
cannot
find
expression
,
or
when
some
thought
that
terrifies
us
lays
sudden
siege
to
the
brain
and
calls
on
us
to
yield
.
after
a
time
the
bee
flew
away
.
he
saw
it
creeping
into
the
stained
trumpet
of
a
tyrian
convolvulus
.
the
flower
seemed
to
quiver
,
and
then
swayed
gently
to
and
fro
.
suddenly
the
painter
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
studio
,
and
made
staccato
signs
for
them
to
come
in
.
they
turned
to
each
other
,
and
smiled
.
"
i
am
waiting
,
"
he
cried
.
"
do
come
in
.
the
light
is
quite
perfect
,
and
you
can
bring
your
drinks
.
"
they
rose
up
,
and
sauntered
down
the
walk
together
.
two
green
-
and
-
white
butterflies
fluttered
past
them
,
and
in
the
pear
-
tree
at
the
corner
of
the
garden
a
thrush
began
to
sing
.
"
you
are
glad
you
have
met
me
,
mr
.
gray
,
"
said
lord
henry
,
looking
at
him
.
"
yes
,
i
am
glad
now
.
i
wonder
shall
i
always
be
glad
?
"
"
always
!
that
is
a
dreadful
word
.
it
makes
me
shudder
when
i
hear
it
.
women
are
so
fond
of
using
it
.
they
spoil
every
romance
by
trying
to
make
it
last
for
ever
.
it
is
a
meaningless
word
,
too
.
the
only
difference
between
a
caprice
and
a
life
-
long
passion
is
that
the
caprice
lasts
a
little
longer
.
"
as
they
entered
the
studio
,
dorian
gray
put
his
hand
upon
lord
henry
'
s
arm
.
"
in
that
case
,
let
our
friendship
be
a
caprice
,
"
he
murmured
,
flushing
at
his
own
boldness
,
then
stepped
up
on
the
platform
and
resumed
his
pose
.
lord
henry
flung
himself
into
a
large
wicker
arm
-
chair
and
watched
him
.
the
sweep
and
dash
of
the
brush
on
the
canvas
made
the
only
sound
that
broke
the
stillness
,
except
when
,
now
and
then
,
hallward
stepped
back
to
look
at
his
work
from
a
distance
.
in
the
slanting
beams
that
streamed
through
the
open
doorway
the
dust
danced
and
was
golden
.
the
heavy
scent
of
the
roses
seemed
to
brood
over
everything
.
after
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
hallward
stopped
painting
,
looked
for
a
long
time
at
dorian
gray
,
and
then
for
a
long
time
at
the
picture
,
biting
the
end
of
one
of
his
huge
brushes
,
and
frowning
.
"
it
is
quite
finished
,
"
he
cried
at
last
,
and
stooping
down
he
wrote
his
name
in
long
vermilion
letters
on
the
left
-
hand
corner
of
the
canvas
.
lord
henry
came
over
and
examined
the
picture
.
it
was
certainly
a
wonderful
work
of
art
,
and
a
wonderful
likeness
as
well
.
"
my
dear
fellow
,
i
congratulate
you
most
warmly
,
"
he
said
.
"
it
is
the
finest
portrait
of
modern
times
.
mr
.
gray
,
come
over
and
look
at
yourself
.
"
the
lad
started
,
as
if
awakened
from
some
dream
.
"
is
it
really
finished
?
"
he
murmured
,
stepping
down
from
the
platform
.
"
quite
finished
,
"
said
the
painter
.
"
and
you
have
sat
splendidly
to
-
day
.
i
am
awfully
obliged
to
you
.
"
"
that
is
entirely
due
to
me
,
"
broke
in
lord
henry
.
"
isn
'
t
it
,
mr
.
gray
?
"
dorian
made
no
answer
,
but
passed
listlessly
in
front
of
his
picture
,
and
turned
towards
it
.
when
he
saw
it
he
drew
back
,
and
his
cheeks
flushed
for
a
moment
with
pleasure
.
a
look
of
joy
came
into
his
eyes
,
as
if
he
had
recognised
himself
for
the
first
time
.
he
stood
there
motionless
and
in
wonder
,
dimly
conscious
that
hallward
was
speaking
to
him
,
but
not
catching
the
meaning
of
his
words
.
the
sense
of
his
own
beauty
came
on
him
like
a
revelation
.
he
had
never
felt
it
before
.
basil
hallward
'
s
compliments
had
seemed
to
him
to
be
merely
the
charming
exaggerations
of
friendship
.
he
had
listened
to
them
,
laughed
at
them
,
forgotten
them
.
they
had
not
influenced
his
nature
.
then
had
come
lord
henry
wotton
with
his
strange
panegyric
on
youth
,
his
terrible
warning
of
its
brevity
.
that
had
stirred
him
at
the
time
,
and
now
,
as
he
stood
gazing
at
the
shadow
of
his
own
loveliness
,
the
full
reality
of
the
description
flashed
across
him
.
yes
,
there
would
be
a
day
when
his
face
would
be
wrinkled
and
wizen
,
his
eyes
dim
and
colourless
,
the
grace
of
his
figure
broken
and
deformed
.
the
scarlet
would
pass
away
from
his
lips
,
and
the
gold
steal
from
his
hair
.
the
life
that
was
to
make
his
soul
would
mar
his
body
.
he
would
become
dreadful
,
hideous
,
and
uncouth
.
as
he
thought
of
it
,
a
sharp
pang
of
pain
struck
through
him
like
a
knife
,
and
made
each
delicate
fibre
of
his
nature
quiver
.
his
eyes
deepened
into
amethyst
,
and
across
them
came
a
mist
of
tears
.
he
felt
as
if
a
hand
of
ice
had
been
laid
upon
his
heart
.
"
don
'
t
you
like
it
?
"
cried
hallward
at
last
,
stung
a
little
by
the
lad
'
s
silence
,
not
understanding
what
it
meant
.
"
of
course
he
likes
it
,
"
said
lord
henry
.
"
who
wouldn
'
t
like
it
?
it
is
one
of
the
greatest
things
in
modern
art
.
i
will
give
you
anything
you
like
to
ask
for
it
.
i
must
have
it
.
"
"
it
is
not
my
property
,
harry
.
"
"
whose
property
is
it
?
"
"
dorian
'
s
,
of
course
,
"
answered
the
painter
.
"
he
is
a
very
lucky
fellow
.
"
"
how
sad
it
is
!
"
murmured
dorian
gray
,
with
his
eyes
still
fixed
upon
his
own
portrait
.
"
how
sad
it
is
!
i
shall
grow
old
,
and
horrible
,
and
dreadful
.
but
this
picture
will
remain
always
young
.
it
will
never
be
older
than
this
particular
day
of
june
.
.
.
.
if
it
were
only
the
other
way
!
if
it
were
i
who
was
to
be
always
young
,
and
the
picture
that
was
to
grow
old
!
for
that
-
-
for
that
-
-
i
would
give
everything
!
yes
,
there
is
nothing
in
the
whole
world
i
would
not
give
!
i
would
give
my
soul
for
that
!
"
"
you
would
hardly
care
for
such
an
arrangement
,
basil
,
"
cried
lord
henry
,
laughing
.
"
it
would
be
rather
hard
lines
on
your
work
.
"
"
i
should
object
very
strongly
,
harry
,
"
said
hallward
.
dorian
gray
turned
and
looked
at
him
.
"
i
believe
you
would
,
basil
.
you
like
your
art
better
than
your
friends
.
i
am
no
more
to
you
than
a
green
bronze
figure
.
hardly
as
much
,
i
daresay
.
"
the
painter
stared
in
amazement
.
it
was
so
unlike
dorian
to
speak
like
that
.
what
had
happened
?
he
seemed
quite
angry
.
his
face
was
flushed
and
his
cheeks
burning
.
"
yes
,
"
he
continued
,
"
i
am
less
to
you
than
your
ivory
hermes
or
your
silver
faun
.
you
will
like
them
always
.
how
long
will
you
like
me
?
till
i
have
my
first
wrinkle
,
i
suppose
.
i
know
,
now
,
that
when
one
loses
one
'
s
good
looks
,
whatever
they
may
be
,
one
loses
everything
.
your
picture
has
taught
me
that
.
lord
henry
wotton
is
perfectly
right
.
youth
is
the
only
thing
worth
having
.
when
i
find
that
i
am
growing
old
,
i
shall
kill
myself
.
"
hallward
turned
pale
,
and
caught
his
hand
.
"
dorian
!
dorian
!
"
he
cried
,
"
don
'
t
talk
like
that
.
i
have
never
had
such
a
friend
as
you
,
and
i
shall
never
have
such
another
.
you
are
not
jealous
of
material
things
,
are
you
?
-
-
you
who
are
finer
than
any
of
them
!
"
"
i
am
jealous
of
everything
whose
beauty
does
not
die
.
i
am
jealous
of
the
portrait
you
have
painted
of
me
.
why
should
it
keep
what
i
must
lose
?
every
moment
that
passes
takes
something
from
me
,
and
gives
something
to
it
.
oh
,
if
it
were
only
the
other
way
!
if
the
picture
could
change
,
and
i
could
be
always
what
i
am
now
!
why
did
you
paint
it
?
it
will
mock
me
some
day
-
-
mock
me
horribly
!
"
the
hot
tears
welled
into
his
eyes
;
he
tore
his
hand
away
,
and
,
flinging
himself
on
the
divan
,
he
buried
his
face
in
the
cushions
,
as
though
he
was
praying
.
"
this
is
your
doing
,
harry
,
"
said
the
painter
,
bitterly
.
lord
henry
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
"
it
is
the
real
dorian
gray
-
-
that
is
all
.
"
"
it
is
not
.
"
"
if
it
is
not
,
what
have
i
to
do
with
it
?
"
"
you
should
have
gone
away
when
i
asked
you
,
"
he
muttered
.
"
i
stayed
when
you
asked
me
,
"
was
lord
henry
'
s
answer
.
"
harry
,
i
can
'
t
quarrel
with
my
two
best
friends
at
once
,
but
between
you
both
you
have
made
me
hate
the
finest
piece
of
work
i
have
ever
done
,
and
i
will
destroy
it
.
what
is
it
but
canvas
and
colour
?
i
will
not
let
it
come
across
our
three
lives
and
mar
them
.
"
dorian
gray
lifted
his
golden
head
from
the
pillow
,
and
with
pallid
face
and
tear
-
stained
eyes
looked
at
him
,
as
he
walked
over
to
the
deal
painting
-
table
that
was
set
beneath
the
high
curtained
window
.
what
was
he
doing
there
?
his
fingers
were
straying
about
among
the
litter
of
tin
tubes
and
dry
brushes
,
seeking
for
something
.
yes
,
it
was
for
the
long
palette
-
knife
,
with
its
thin
blade
of
lithe
steel
.
he
had
found
it
at
last
.
he
was
going
to
rip
up
the
canvas
.
with
a
stifled
sob
the
lad
leaped
from
the
couch
,
and
,
rushing
over
to
hallward
,
tore
the
knife
out
of
his
hand
,
and
flung
it
to
the
end
of
the
studio
.
"
don
'
t
,
basil
,
don
'
t
!
"
he
cried
.
"
it
would
be
murder
!
"
"
i
am
glad
you
appreciate
my
work
at
last
,
dorian
,
"
said
the
painter
,
coldly
,
when
he
had
recovered
from
his
surprise
.
"
i
never
thought
you
would
.
"
"
appreciate
it
?
i
am
in
love
with
it
,
basil
.
it
is
part
of
myself
.
i
feel
that
.
"
"
well
,
as
soon
as
you
are
dry
,
you
shall
be
varnished
,
and
framed
,
and
sent
home
.
then
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
yourself
.
"
and
he
walked
across
the
room
and
rang
the
bell
for
tea
.
"
you
will
have
tea
,
of
course
,
dorian
?
and
so
will
you
,
harry
?
or
do
you
object
to
such
simple
pleasures
?
"
"
i
adore
simple
pleasures
,
"
said
lord
henry
.
"
they
are
the
last
refuge
of
the
complex
.
but
i
don
'
t
like
scenes
,
except
on
the
stage
.
what
absurd
fellows
you
are
,
both
of
you
!
i
wonder
who
it
was
defined
man
as
a
rational
animal
.
it
was
the
most
premature
definition
ever
given
.
man
is
many
things
,
but
he
is
not
rational
.
i
am
glad
he
is
not
,
after
all
:
though
i
wish
you
chaps
would
not
squabble
over
the
picture
.
you
had
much
better
let
me
have
it
,
basil
.
this
silly
boy
doesn
'
t
really
want
it
,
and
i
really
do
.
"
"
if
you
let
anyone
have
it
but
me
,
basil
,
i
shall
never
forgive
you
!
"
cried
dorian
gray
;
"
and
i
don
'
t
allow
people
to
call
me
a
silly
boy
.
"
"
you
know
the
picture
is
yours
,
dorian
.
i
gave
it
to
you
before
it
existed
.
"
"
and
you
know
you
have
been
a
little
silly
,
mr
.
gray
,
and
that
you
don
'
t
really
object
to
being
reminded
that
you
are
extremely
young
.
"
"
i
should
have
objected
very
strongly
this
morning
,
lord
henry
.
"
"
ah
!
this
morning
!
you
have
lived
since
then
.
"
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
,
and
the
butler
entered
with
a
laden
tea
-
tray
and
set
it
down
upon
a
small
japanese
table
.
there
was
a
rattle
of
cups
and
saucers
and
the
hissing
of
a
fluted
georgian
urn
.
two
globe
-
shaped
china
dishes
were
brought
in
by
a
page
.
dorian
gray
went
over
and
poured
out
the
tea
.
the
two
men
sauntered
languidly
to
the
table
,
and
examined
what
was
under
the
covers
.
"
let
us
go
to
the
theatre
to
-
night
,
"
said
lord
henry
.
"
there
is
sure
to
be
something
on
,
somewhere
.
i
have
promised
to
dine
at
white
'
s
,
but
it
is
only
with
an
old
friend
,
so
i
can
send
him
a
wire
to
say
that
i
am
ill
,
or
that
i
am
prevented
from
coming
in
consequence
of
a
subsequent
engagement
.
i
think
that
would
be
a
rather
nice
excuse
:
it
would
have
all
the
surprise
of
candour
.
"
"
it
is
such
a
bore
putting
on
one
'
s
dress
-
clothes
,
"
muttered
hallward
.
"
and
,
when
one
has
them
on
,
they
are
so
horrid
.
"
"
yes
,
"
answered
lord
henry
,
dreamily
,
"
the
costume
of
the
nineteenth
century
is
detestable
.
it
is
so
sombre
,
so
depressing
.
sin
is
the
only
real
colour
-
element
left
in
modern
life
.
"
"
you
really
must
not
say
things
like
that
before
dorian
,
harry
.
"
"
before
which
dorian
?
the
one
who
is
pouring
out
tea
for
us
,
or
the
one
in
the
picture
?
"
"
before
either
.
"
"
i
should
like
to
come
to
the
theatre
with
you
,
lord
henry
,
"
said
the
lad
.
"
then
you
shall
come
;
and
you
will
come
too
,
basil
,
won
'
t
you
?
"
"
i
can
'
t
really
.
i
would
sooner
not
.
i
have
a
lot
of
work
to
do
.
"
"
well
,
then
,
you
and
i
will
go
alone
,
mr
.
gray
.
"
"
i
should
like
that
awfully
.
"
the
painter
bit
his
lip
and
walked
over
,
cup
in
hand
,
to
the
picture
.
"
i
shall
stay
with
the
real
dorian
,
"
he
said
,
sadly
.
"
is
it
the
real
dorian
?
"
cried
the
original
of
the
portrait
,
strolling
across
to
him
.
"
am
i
really
like
that
?
"
"
yes
;
you
are
just
like
that
.
"
"
how
wonderful
,
basil
!
"
"
at
least
you
are
like
it
in
appearance
.
but
it
will
never
alter
,
"
sighed
hallward
.
"
that
is
something
.
"
"
what
a
fuss
people
make
about
fidelity
!
"
exclaimed
lord
henry
.
"
why
,
even
in
love
it
is
purely
a
question
for
physiology
.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
own
will
.
young
men
want
to
be
faithful
,
and
are
not
;
old
men
want
to
be
faithless
,
and
cannot
:
that
is
all
one
can
say
.
"
"
don
'
t
go
to
the
theatre
to
-
night
,
dorian
,
"
said
hallward
.
"
stop
and
dine
with
me
.
"
"
i
can
'
t
,
basil
.
"
"
why
?
"
"
because
i
have
promised
lord
henry
wotton
to
go
with
him
.
"
"
he
won
'
t
like
you
the
better
for
keeping
your
promises
.
he
always
breaks
his
own
.
i
beg
you
not
to
go
.
"
dorian
gray
laughed
and
shook
his
head
.
"
i
entreat
you
.
"
the
lad
hesitated
,
and
looked
over
at
lord
henry
,
who
was
watching
them
from
the
tea
-
table
with
an
amused
smile
.
"
i
must
go
,
basil
,
"
he
answered
.
"
very
well
,
"
said
hallward
;
and
he
went
over
and
laid
down
his
cup
on
the
tray
.
"
it
is
rather
late
,
and
,
as
you
have
to
dress
,
you
had
better
lose
no
time
.
good
-
bye
,
harry
.
good
-
bye
,
dorian
.
come
and
see
me
soon
.
come
to
-
morrow
.
"
"
certainly
.
"
"
you
won
'
t
forget
?
"
"
no
,
of
course
not
,
"
cried
dorian
.
"
and
.
.
.
harry
!
"
"
yes
,
basil
?
"
"
remember
what
i
asked
you
,
when
we
were
in
the
garden
this
morning
.
"
"
i
have
forgotten
it
.
"
"
i
trust
you
.
"
"
i
wish
i
could
trust
myself
,
"
said
lord
henry
,
laughing
.
"
come
,
mr
.
gray
,
my
hansom
is
outside
,
and
i
can
drop
you
at
your
own
place
.
good
-
bye
,
basil
.
it
has
been
a
most
interesting
afternoon
.
"
as
the
door
closed
behind
them
,
the
painter
flung
himself
down
on
a
sofa
,
and
a
look
of
pain
came
into
his
face
.
chapter
iii
at
half
-
past
twelve
next
day
lord
henry
wotton
strolled
from
curzon
street
over
to
the
albany
to
call
on
his
uncle
,
lord
fermor
,
a
genial
if
somewhat
rough
-
mannered
old
bachelor
,
whom
the
outside
world
called
selfish
because
it
derived
no
particular
benefit
from
him
,
but
who
was
considered
generous
by
society
as
he
fed
the
people
who
amused
him
.
his
father
had
been
our
ambassador
at
madrid
when
isabella
was
young
,
and
prim
unthought
of
,
but
had
retired
from
the
diplomatic
service
in
a
capricious
moment
of
annoyance
at
not
being
offered
the
embassy
at
paris
,
a
post
to
which
he
considered
that
he
was
fully
entitled
by
reason
of
his
birth
,
his
indolence
,
the
good
english
of
his
despatches
,
and
his
inordinate
passion
for
pleasure
.
the
son
,
who
had
been
his
father
'
s
secretary
,
had
resigned
along
with
his
chief
,
somewhat
foolishly
as
was
thought
at
the
time
,
and
on
succeeding
some
months
later
to
the
title
,
had
set
himself
to
the
serious
study
of
the
great
aristocratic
art
of
doing
absolutely
nothing
.
he
had
two
large
town
houses
,
but
preferred
to
live
in
chambers
,
as
it
was
less
trouble
,
and
took
most
of
his
meals
at
his
club
.
he
paid
some
attention
to
the
management
of
his
collieries
in
the
midland
counties
,
excusing
himself
for
this
taint
of
industry
on
the
ground
that
the
one
advantage
of
having
coal
was
that
it
enabled
a
gentleman
to
afford
the
decency
of
burning
wood
on
his
own
hearth
.
in
politics
he
was
a
tory
,
except
when
the
tories
were
in
office
,
during
which
period
he
roundly
abused
them
for
being
a
pack
of
radicals
.
he
was
a
hero
to
his
valet
,
who
bullied
him
,
and
a
terror
to
most
of
his
relations
,
whom
he
bullied
in
turn
.
only
england
could
have
produced
him
,
and
he
always
said
that
the
country
was
going
to
the
dogs
.
his
principles
were
out
of
date
,
but
there
was
a
good
deal
to
be
said
for
his
prejudices
.
when
lord
henry
entered
the
room
,
he
found
his
uncle
sitting
in
a
rough
shooting
coat
,
smoking
a
cheroot
,
and
grumbling
over
_
the
times
_
.
"
well
,
harry
,
"
said
the
old
gentleman
,
"
what
brings
you
out
so
early
?
i
thought
you
dandies
never
got
up
till
two
,
and
were
not
visible
till
five
.
"
"
pure
family
affection
,
i
assure
you
,
uncle
george
.
i
want
to
get
something
out
of
you
.
"
"
money
,
i
suppose
,
"
said
lord
fermor
,
making
a
wry
face
.
"
well
,
sit
down
and
tell
me
all
about
it
.
young
people
,
nowadays
,
imagine
that
money
is
everything
.
"
"
yes
,
"
murmured
lord
henry
,
settling
his
buttonhole
in
his
coat
;
"
and
when
they
grow
older
they
know
it
.
but
i
don
'
t
want
money
.
it
is
only
people
who
pay
their
bills
who
want
that
,
uncle
george
,
and
i
never
pay
mine
.
credit
is
the
capital
of
a
younger
son
,
and
one
lives
charmingly
upon
it
.
besides
,
i
always
deal
with
dartmoor
'
s
tradesmen
,
and
consequently
they
never
bother
me
.
what
i
want
is
information
;
not
useful
information
,
of
course
;
useless
information
.
"
"
well
,
i
can
tell
you
anything
that
is
in
an
english
blue
-
book
,
harry
,
although
those
fellows
nowadays
write
a
lot
of
nonsense
.
when
i
was
in
the
diplomatic
,
things
were
much
better
.
but
i
hear
they
let
them
in
now
by
examination
.
what
can
you
expect
?
examinations
,
sir
,
are
pure
humbug
from
beginning
to
end
.
if
a
man
is
a
gentleman
,
he
knows
quite
enough
,
and
if
he
is
not
a
gentleman
,
whatever
he
knows
is
bad
for
him
.

you
have
known

the
old

-
"
kelso
'
s
grandson
!
.
.
.
of
course
.
.
.
.
i
knew
his
mother
intimately
.
i
believe
i
was
at
her
christening
.
she
was
an
extraordinarily
beautiful
girl
,
margaret
devereux
;
and
made
all
the
men
frantic
by
running
away
with
a
penniless
young
fellow
;
a
mere
nobody
,
sir
,
a
subaltern
in
a
foot
regiment
,
or
something
of
that
kind
.
certainly
.
i
remember
the
whole
thing
as
if
it
happened
yesterday
.
the
poor
chap
was
killed
in
a
duel
at
spa
,
a
few
months
after
the
marriage
.
there
was
an
ugly
story
about
it
.
they
said
kelso
got
some
rascally
adventurer
,
some
belgian
brute
,
to
insult
his
son
-
in
-
law
in
public
;
paid
him
,
sir
,
to
do
it
,
paid
him
;
and
that
the
fellow
spitted
his
man
as
if
he
had
been
a
pigeon
.
the
thing
was
hushed
up
,
but
,
egad
,
kelso
ate
his
chop
alone
at
the
club
for
some
time
afterwards
.
he
brought
his
daughter
back
with
him
,
i
was
told
,
and
she
never
spoke
to
him
again
.
oh
,
yes
;
it
was
a
bad
business
.
the
girl
died
too
;
died
within
a
year
.
so
she
left
a
son
,
did
she
?
i
had
forgotten
that
.
what
sort
of
boy
is
he
?
if
he
is
like
his
mother
he
must
be
a
good
-
looking
chap
.
"
"
he
is
very
good
-
looking
,
"
assented
lord
henry
.
"
i
hope
he
will
fall
into
proper
hands
,
"
continued
the
old
man
.
"
he
should
have
a
pot
of
money
waiting
for
him
if
kelso
did
the
right
thing
by
him
.
his
mother
had
money
too
.
all
the
selby
property
came
to
her
,
through
her
grandfather
.
her
grandfather
hated
kelso
,
thought
him
a
mean
dog
.
he
was
,
too
.
came
to
madrid
once
when
i
was
there
.
egad
,
i
was
ashamed
of
him
.
the
queen
used
to
ask
me
about
the
english
noble
who
was
always
quarrelling
with
the
cabmen
about
their
fares
.
they
made
quite
a
story
of
it
.
i
didn
'
t
dare
to
show
my
face
at
court
for
a
month
.
i
hope
he
treated
his
grandson
better
than
he
did
the
jarvies
.
"
"
i
don
'

know
,
"
answered
lord
henry

"
i
fancy
that
the
boy
will
be
well
off

is
not
of
age
yet

he
has

told

so

his

was
very
beautiful

"
"
margaret
devereux
was
one
of
the
loveliest
creatures
i
ever
saw
,
harry
.
what
on
earth
induced
her
to
behave
as
she
did
,
i
never
could
understand
.
she
could
have
married
anybody
she
chose
.
carlington
was
mad
after
her
.
she
was
romantic
,
though
.
all
the
women
of
that
family
were
.
the
men
were
a
poor
lot
,
but
,
egad
!
the
women
were
wonderful
.
carlington
went
on
his
knees
to
her
.
told
me
so
himself
.
she
laughed
at
him
,
and
there
wasn

a
girl
in
london
at
the
time
who
wasn

after
him

by
the
way

harry

talking
about
silly
marriages

what
is
this
humbug
your

about

american

enough

back

striking

on

that

the
reason

tell

not
to
bother
me
any
more
with
her
charity

am
sick
of

why

good
woman
thinks
that

have
nothing

to
write
cheques
for
her
silly
fads

"
"
all
right
,
uncle
george
,
i
'
ll
tell
her
,
but
it
won
'
t
have
any
effect
.
philanthropic
people
lose
all
sense
of
humanity
.
it
is
their
distinguishing
characteristic
.
"
the
old
gentleman
growled
approvingly
,
and
rang
the
bell
for
his
servant
.
lord
henry
passed
up
the
low
arcade
into
burlington
street
,
and
turned
his
steps
in
the
direction
of
berkeley
square
.
so
that
was
the
story
of
dorian
gray
'
s
parentage
.
crudely
as
it
had
been
told
to
him
,
it
had
yet
stirred
him
by
its
suggestion
of
a
strange
,
almost
modern
romance
.
a
beautiful
woman
risking
everything
for
a
mad
passion
.
a
few
wild
weeks
of
happiness
cut
short
by
a
hideous
,
treacherous
crime
.
months
of
voiceless
agony
,
and
then
a
child
born
in
pain
.
the
mother
snatched
away
by
death
,
the
boy
left
to
solitude
and
the
tyranny
of
an
old
and
loveless
man
.
yes
;
it
was
an
interesting
background
.
it
posed
the
lad
,
made
him
more
perfect
as
it
were
.
behind
every
exquisite
thing
that
existed
,
there
was
something
tragic
.
worlds
had
to
be
in
travail
,
that
the
meanest
flower
might
blow
.
.
.
.
and
how
charming
he
had
been
at
dinner
the
night
before
,
as
,
with
startled
eyes
and
lips
parted
in
frightened
pleasure
,
he
had
sat
opposite
to
him
at
the
club
,
the
red
candleshades
staining
to
a
richer
rose
the
wakening
wonder
of
his
face
.
talking
to
him
was
like
playing
upon
an
exquisite
violin
.
he
answered
to
every
touch
and
thrill
of
the
bow
.
.
.
.
there
was
something
terribly
enthralling
in
the
exercise
of
influence
.
no
other
activity
was
like
it
.
to
project
one
'
s
soul
into
some
gracious
form
,
and
let
it
tarry
there
for
a
moment
;
to
hear
one
'
s
own
intellectual
views
echoed
back
to
one
with
all
the
added
music
of
passion
and
youth
;
to
convey
one
'
s
temperament
into
another
as
though
it
were
a
subtle
fluid
or
a
strange
perfume
;
there
was
a
real
joy
in
that
-
-
perhaps
the
most
satisfying
joy
left
to
us
in
an
age
so
limited
and
vulgar
as
our
own
,
an
age
grossly
carnal
in
its
pleasures
,
and
grossly
common
in
its
aims
.
.
.
.
he
was
a
marvellous
type
,
too
,
this
lad
,
whom
by
so
curious
a
chance
he
had
met
in
basil
'
s
studio
;
or
could
be
fashioned
into
a
marvellous
type
,
at
any
rate
.
grace
was
his
,
and
the
white
purity
of
boyhood
,
and
beauty
such
as
old
greek
marbles
kept
for
us
.
there
was
nothing
that
one
could
not
do
with
him
.
he
could
be
made
a
titan
or
a
toy
.
what
a
pity
it
was
that
such
beauty
was
destined
to
fade
!
.
.
.
and
basil
?
from
a
psychological
point
of
view
,
how
interesting
he
was
!
the
new
manner
in
art
,
the
fresh
mode
of
looking
at
life
,
suggested
so
strangely
by
the
merely
visible
presence
of
one
who
was
unconscious
of
it
all
;
the
silent
spirit
that
dwelt
in
dim
woodland
,
and
walked
unseen
in
open
field
,
suddenly
showing
herself
,
dryad
-
like
and
not
afraid
,
because
in
his
soul
who
sought
for
her
there
had
been
wakened
that
wonderful
vision
to
which
alone
are
wonderful
things
revealed
;
the
mere
shapes
and
patterns
of
things
becoming
,
as
it
were
,
refined
,
and
gaining
a
kind
of
symbolical
value
,
as
though
they
were
themselves
patterns
of
some
other
and
more
perfect
form
whose
shadow
they
made
real
:
how
strange
it
all
was
!
he
remembered
something
like
it
in
history
.
was
it
not
plato
,
that
artist
in
thought
,
who
had
first
analysed
it
?
was
it
not
buonarotti
who
had
carved
it
in
the
coloured
marbles
of
a
sonnet
-
sequence
?
but
in
our
own
century
it
was
strange
.
.
.
.
yes
;
he
would
try
to
be
to
dorian
gray
what
,
without
knowing
it
,
the
lad
was
to
the
painter
who
had
fashioned
the
wonderful
portrait
.
he
would
seek
to
dominate
him
-
-
had
already
,
indeed
,
half
done
so
.
he
would
make
that
wonderful
spirit
his
own
.
there
was
something
fascinating
in
this
son
of
love
and
death
.
suddenly
he
stopped
,
and
glanced
up
at
the
houses
.
he
found
that
he
had
passed
his
aunt
'
s
some
distance
,
and
,
smiling
to
himself
,
turned
back
.
when
he
entered
the
somewhat
sombre
hall
the
butler
told
him
that
they
had
gone
in
to
lunch
.
he
gave
one
of
the
footmen
his
hat
and
stick
,
and
passed
into
the
dining
-
room
.
"
late
as
usual
,
harry
,
"
cried
his
aunt
,
shaking
her
head
at
him
.
he
invented
a
facile
excuse
,
and
having
taken
the
vacant
seat
next
to
her
,
looked
round
to
see
who
was
there
.
dorian
bowed
to
him
shyly
from
the
end
of
the
table
,
a
flush
of
pleasure
stealing
into
his
cheek
.
opposite
was
the
duchess
of
harley
;
a
lady
of
admirable
good
-
nature
and
good
temper
,
much
liked
by
everyone
who
knew
her
,
and
of
those
ample
architectural
proportions
that
in
women
who
are
not
duchesses
are
described
by
contemporary
historians
as
stoutness
.
next
to
her
sat
,
on
her
right
,
sir
thomas
burdon
,
a
radical
member
of
parliament
,
who
followed
his
leader
in
public
life
,
and
in
private
life
followed
the
best
cooks
,
dining
with
the
tories
,
and
thinking
with
the
liberals
,
in
accordance
with
a
wise
and
well
-
known
rule
.
the
post
on
her
left
was
occupied
by
mr
.
erskine
of
treadley
,
an
old
gentleman
of
considerable
charm
and
culture
,
who
had
fallen
,
however
,
into
bad
habits
of
silence
,
having
,
as
he
explained
once
to
lady
agatha
,
said
everything
that
he
had
to
say
before
he
was
thirty
.
his
own
neighbour
was
mrs
.
vandeleur
,
one
of
his
aunt
'
s
oldest
friends
,
a
perfect
saint
amongst
women
,
but
so
dreadfully
dowdy
that
she
reminded
one
of
a
badly
bound
hymn
-
book
.
fortunately
for
him
she
had
on
the
other
side
lord
faudel
,
a
most
intelligent
middle
-
aged
mediocrity
,
as
bald
as
a
ministerial
statement
in
the
house
of
commons
,
with
whom
she
was
conversing
in
that
intensely
earnest
manner
which
is
the
one
unpardonable
error
,
as
he
remarked
once
himself
,
that
all
really
good
people
fall
into
,
and
from
which
none
of
them
ever
quite
escape
.
"
we
are
talking
about
poor
dartmoor
,
lord
henry
,
"
cried
the
duchess
,
nodding
pleasantly
to
him
across
the
table
.
"
do
you
think
he
will
really
marry
this
fascinating
young
person
?
"
"
i
believe
she
has
made
up
her
mind
to
propose
to
him
,
duchess
.
"
"
how
dreadful
!
"
exclaimed
lady
agatha
.
"
really
,
someone
should
interfere
.
"
"
i
am
told
,
on
excellent
authority
,
that
her
father
keeps
an
american
dry
-
goods
store
,
"
said
sir
thomas
burdon
,
looking
supercilious
.
"
my
uncle
has
already
suggested
pork
-
packing
,
sir
thomas
.
"
"
dry
-
goods
!
what
are
american
dry
-
goods
?
"
asked
the
duchess
,
raising
her
large
hands
in
wonder
,
and
accentuating
the
verb
.
"
american
novels
,
"
answered
lord
henry
,
helping
himself
to
some
quail
.
the
duchess
looked
puzzled
.
"
don
'
t
mind
him
,
my
dear
,
"
whispered
lady
agatha
.
"
he
never
means
anything
that
he
says
.
"
"
when
america
was
discovered
,
"
said
the
radical
member
,
and
he
began
to
give
some
wearisome
facts
.
like
all
people
who
try
to
exhaust
a
subject
,
he
exhausted
his
listeners
.
the
duchess
sighed
,
and
exercised
her
privilege
of
interruption
.
"
i
wish
to
goodness
it
never
had
been
discovered
at
all
!
"
she
exclaimed
.
"
really
,
our
girls
have
no
chance
nowadays
.
it
is
most
unfair
.
"
"
perhaps
,
after
all
,
america
never
has
been
discovered
,
"
said
mr
.
erskine
.
"
i
myself
would
say
that
it
had
merely
been
detected
.
"
"
oh
!
but
i
have
seen
specimens
of
the
inhabitants
,
"
answered
the
duchess
,
vaguely
.
"
i
must
confess
that
most
of
them
are
extremely
pretty
.
and
they
dress
well
,
too
.
they
get
all
their
dresses
in
paris
.
i
wish
i
could
afford
to
do
the
same
.
"
"
they
say
that
when
good
americans
die
they
go
to
paris
,
"
chuckled
sir
thomas
,
who
had
a
large
wardrobe
of
humour
'
s
cast
-
off
clothes
.
"
really
!
and
where
do
bad
americans
go
to
when
they
die
?
"
inquired
the
duchess
.
"
they
go
to
america
,
"
murmured
lord
henry
.
sir
thomas
frowned
.
"
i
am
afraid
that
your
nephew
is
prejudiced
against
that
great
country
,
"
he
said
to
lady
agatha
.
"
i
have
travelled
all
over
it
,
in
cars
provided
by
the
directors
,
who
,
in
such
matters
,
are
extremely
civil
.
i
assure
you
that
it
is
an
education
to
visit
it
.
"
"
but
must
we
really
see
chicago
in
order
to
be
educated
?
"
asked
mr
.
erskine
,
plaintively
.
"
i
don
'
t
feel
up
to
the
journey
.
"
sir
thomas
waved
his
hand
.
"
mr
.
erskine
of
treadley
has
the
world
on
his
shelves
.
we
practical
men
like
to
see
things
,
not
to
read
about
them
.
the
americans
are
an
extremely
interesting
people
.
they
are
absolutely
reasonable
.
i
think
that
is
their
distinguishing
characteristic
.
yes
,
mr
.
erskine
,
an
absolutely
reasonable
people
.
i
assure
you
there
is
no
nonsense
about
the
americans
.
"
"
how
dreadful
!
"
cried
lord
henry
.
"
i
can
stand
brute
force
,
but
brute
reason
is
quite
unbearable
.
there
is
something
unfair
about
its
use
.
it
is
hitting
below
the
intellect
.
"
"
i
do
not
understand
you
,
"
said
sir
thomas
,
growing
rather
red
.
"
i
do
,
lord
henry
,
"
murmured
mr
.
erskine
,
with
a
smile
.
"
paradoxes
are
all
very
well
in
their
way
.
.
.
.
"
rejoined
the
baronet
.
"
was
that
a
paradox
?
"
asked
mr
.
erskine
.
"
i
did
not
think
so
.
perhaps
it
was
.
well
,
the
way
of
paradoxes
is
the
way
of
truth
.
to
test
reality
we
must
see
it
on
the
tight
-
rope
.
when
the
verities
become
acrobats
we
can
judge
them
.
"
"
dear
me
!
"
said
lady
agatha
,
"
how
you
men
argue
!
i
am
sure
i
never
can
make
out
what
you
are
talking
about
.
oh
!
harry
,
i
am
quite
vexed
with
you
.
why
do
you
try
to
persuade
our
nice
mr
.
dorian
gray
to
give
up
the
east
end
?
i
assure
you
he
would
be
quite
invaluable
.
they
would
love
his
playing
.
"
"
i
want
him
to
play
to
me
,
"
cried
lord
henry
,
smiling
,
and
he
looked
down
the
table
and
caught
a
bright
answering
glance
.
"
but
they
are
so
unhappy
in
whitechapel
,
"
continued
lady
agatha
.
"
i
can
sympathise
with
everything
,
except
suffering
,
"
said
lord
henry
,
shrugging
his
shoulders
.
"
i
cannot
sympathise
with
that
.
it
is
too
ugly
,
too
horrible
,
too
distressing
.
there
is
something
terribly
morbid
in
the
modern
sympathy
with
pain
.
one
should
sympathise
with
the
colour
,
the
beauty
,
the
joy
of
life
.
the
less
said
about
life
'
s
sores
the
better
.
"
"
still
,
the
east
end
is
a
very
important
problem
,
"
remarked
sir
thomas
,
with
a
grave
shake
of
the
head
.
"
quite
so
,
"
answered
the
young
lord
.
"
it
is
the
problem
of
slavery
,
and
we
try
to
solve
it
by
amusing
the
slaves
.
"
the
politician
looked
at
him
keenly
.
"
what
change
do
you
propose
,
then
?
"
he
asked
.
lord
henry
laughed
.
"
i
don
'
t
desire
to
change
anything
in
england
except
the
weather
,
"
he
answered
.
"
i
am
quite
content
with
philosophic
contemplation
.
but
,
as
the
nineteenth
century
has
gone
bankrupt
through
an
over
-
expenditure
of
sympathy
,
i
would
suggest
that
we
should
appeal
to
science
to
put
us
straight
.
the
advantage
of
the
emotions
is
that
they
lead
us
astray
,
and
the
advantage
of
science
is
that
it
is
not
emotional
.
"
"
but
we
have
such
grave
responsibilities
,
"
ventured
mrs
.
vandeleur
,
timidly
.
"
terribly
grave
,
"
echoed
lady
agatha
.
lord
henry
looked
over
at
mr
.
erskine
.
"
humanity
takes
itself
too
seriously
.
it
is
the
world
'
s
original
sin
.
if
the
caveman
had
known
how
to
laugh
,
history
would
have
been
different
.
"
"
you
are
really
very
comforting
,
"
warbled
the
duchess
.
"
i
have
always
felt
rather
guilty
when
i
came
to
see
your
dear
aunt
,
for
i
take
no
interest
at
all
in
the
east
end
.
for
the
future
i
shall
be
able
to
look
her
in
the
face
without
a
blush
.
"
"
a
blush
is
very
becoming
,
duchess
,
"
remarked
lord
henry
.
"
only
when
one
is
young
,
"
she
answered
.
"
when
an
old
woman
like
myself
blushes
,
it
is
a
very
bad
sign
.
ah
!
lord
henry
,
i
wish
you
would
tell
me
how
to
become
young
again
.
"
he
thought
for
a
moment
.
"
can
you
remember
any
great
error
that
you
committed
in
your
early
days
,
duchess
?
"
he
asked
,
looking
at
her
across
the
table
.
"
a
great
many
,
i
fear
,
"
she
cried
.
"
then
commit
them
over
again
,
"
he
said
,
gravely
.
"
to
get
back
one
'
s
youth
,
one
has
merely
to
repeat
one
'
s
follies
.
"
"
a
delightful
theory
!
"
she
exclaimed
.
"
i
must
put
it
into
practice
.
"
"
a
dangerous
theory
!
"
came
from
sir
thomas
'
s
tight
lips
.
lady
agatha
shook
her
head
,
but
could
not
help
being
amused
.
mr
.
erskine
listened
.
"
yes
,
"
he
continued
,
"
that
is
one
of
the
great
secrets
of
life
.
nowadays
most
people
die
of
a
sort
of
creeping
common
sense
,
and
discover
when
it
is
too
late
that
the
only
things
one
never
regrets
are
one
'
s
mistakes
.
"
a
laugh
ran
round
the
table
.
he
played
with
the
idea
,
and
grew
wilful
;
tossed
it
into
the
air
and
transformed
it
;
let
it
escape
and
recaptured
it
;
made
it
iridescent
with
fancy
,
and
winged
it
with
paradox
.
the
praise
of
folly
,
as
he
went
on
,
soared
into
a
philosophy
,
and
philosophy
herself
became
young
,
and
catching
the
mad
music
of
pleasure
,
wearing
,
one
might
fancy
,
her
wine
-
stained
robe
and
wreath
of
ivy
,
danced
like
a
bacchante
over
the
hills
of
life
,
and
mocked
the
slow
silenus
for
being
sober
.
facts
fled
before
her
like
frightened
forest
things
.
her
white
feet
trod
the
huge
press
at
which
wise
omar
sits
,
till
the
seething
grape
-
juice
rose
round
her
bare
limbs
in
waves
of
purple
bubbles
,
or
crawled
in
red
foam
over
the
vat
'
s
black
,
dripping
,
sloping
sides
.
it
was
an
extraordinary
improvisation
.
he
felt
that
the
eyes
of
dorian
gray
were
fixed
on
him
,
and
the
consciousness
that
amongst
his
audience
there
was
one
whose
temperament
he
wished
to
fascinate
,
seemed
to
give
his
wit
keenness
,
and
to
lend
colour
to
his
imagination
.
he
was
brilliant
,
fantastic
,
irresponsible
.
he
charmed
his
listeners
out
of
themselves
,
and
they
followed
his
pipe
laughing
.
dorian
gray
never
took
his
gaze
off
him
,
but
sat
like
one
under
a
spell
,
smiles
chasing
each
other
over
his
lips
,
and
wonder
growing
grave
in
his
darkening
eyes
.
at
last
,
liveried
in
the
costume
of
the
age
,
reality
entered
the
room
in
the
shape
of
a
servant
to
tell
the
duchess
that
her
carriage
was
waiting
.
she
wrung
her
hands
in
mock
despair
.
"
how
annoying
!
"
she
cried
.
"
i
must
go
.
i
have
to
call
for
my
husband
at
the
club
,
to
take
him
to
some
absurd
meeting
at
willis
'
s
rooms
,
where
he
is
going
to
be
in
the
chair
.
if
i
am
late
,
he
is
sure
to
be
furious
,
and
i
couldn
'
t
have
a
scene
in
this
bonnet
.
it
is
far
too
fragile
.
a
harsh
word
would
ruin
it
.
no
,
i
must
go
,
dear
agatha
.
good
-
bye
,
lord
henry
,
you
are
quite
delightful
,
and
dreadfully
demoralising
.
i
am
sure
i
don
'
t
know
what
to
say
about
your
views
.
you
must
come
and
dine
with
us
some
night
.
tuesday
?
are
you
disengaged
tuesday
?
"
"
for
you
i
would
throw
over
anybody
,
duchess
,
"
said
lord
henry
,
with
a
bow
.
"
ah
!
that
is
very
nice
,
and
very
wrong
of
you
,
"
she
cried
;
"
so
mind
you
come
;
"
and
she
swept
out
of
the
room
,
followed
by
lady
agatha
and
the
other
ladies
.
when
lord
henry
had
sat
down
again
,
mr
.
erskine
moved
round
,
and
taking
a
chair
close
to
him
,
placed
his
hand
upon
his
arm
.
"
you
talk
books
away
,
"
he
said
;
"
why
don
'
t
you
write
one
?
"
"
i
am
too
fond
of
reading
books
to
care
to
write
them
,
mr
.
erskine
.
i
should
like
to
write
a
novel
certainly
;
a
novel
that
would
be
as
lovely
as
a
persian
carpet
,
and
as
unreal
.
but
there
is
no
literary
public
in
england
for
anything
except
newspapers
,
primers
,
and
encyclop
dias
.
of
all
people
in
the
world
the
english
have
the
least
sense
of
the
beauty
of
literature
.
"
"
i
fear
you
are
right
,
"
answered
mr
.
erskine
.
"
i
myself
used
to
have
literary
ambitions
,
but
i
gave
them
up
long
ago
.
and
now
,
my
dear
young
friend
,
if
you
will
allow
me
to
call
you
so
,
may
i
ask
if
you
really
meant
all
that
you
said
to
us
at
lunch
?
"
"
i
quite
forget
what
i
said
,
"
smiled
lord
henry
.
"
was
it
all
very
bad
?
"
"
very
bad
indeed
.
in
fact
i
consider
you
extremely
dangerous
,
and
if
anything
happens
to
our
good
duchess
we
shall
all
look
on
you
as
being
primarily
responsible
.
but
i
should
like
to
talk
to
you
about
life
.
the
generation
into
which
i
was
born
was
tedious
.
some
day
,
when
you
are
tired
of
london
,
come
down
to
treadley
,
and
expound
to
me
your
philosophy
of
pleasure
over
some
admirable
burgundy
i
am
fortunate
enough
to
possess
.
"
"
i
shall
be
charmed
.
a
visit
to
treadley
would
be
a
great
privilege
.
it
has
a
perfect
host
,
and
a
perfect
library
.
"
"
you
will
complete
it
,
"
answered
the
old
gentleman
,
with
a
courteous
bow
.
"
and
now
i
must
bid
good
-
bye
to
your
excellent
aunt
.
i
am
due
at
the
athen
um
.
it
is
the
hour
when
we
sleep
there

all
of
you

erskine

"
forty
of
us
,
in
forty
arm
-
chairs
.
we
are
practising
for
an
english
academy
of
letters
.
"
lord
henry
laughed
,
and
rose
.
"
i
am
going
to
the
park
,
"
he
cried
.
as
he
was
passing
out
of
the
door
dorian
gray
touched
him
on
the
arm
.
"
let
me
come
with
you
,
"
he
murmured
.
"
but
i
thought
you
had
promised
basil
hallward
to
go
and
see
him
,
"
answered
lord
henry
.
"
i
would
sooner
come
with
you
;
yes
,
i
feel
i
must
come
with
you
.
do
let
me
.
and
you
will
promise
to
talk
to
me
all
the
time
?
no
one
talks
so
wonderfully
as
you
do
.
"
"
ah
!
i
have
talked
quite
enough
for
to
-
day
,
"
said
lord
henry
,
smiling
.
"
all
i
want
now
is
to
look
at
life
.
you
may
come
and
look
at
it
with
me
,
if
you
care
to
.

,
dorian
gray
was
reclining
in
a
luxurious
arm
-
chair
,
in
the
little
library
of
lord
henry
'
s
house
in
mayfair
.
it
was
,
in
its
way
,
a
very
charming
room
,
with
its
high
-
panelled
wainscoting
of
olive
-
stained
oak
,
its
cream
-
coloured
frieze
and
ceiling
of
raised
plaster
-
work
,
and
its
brickdust
felt
carpet
strewn
with
silk
long
-
fringed
persian
rugs
.
on
a
tiny
satinwood
table
stood
a
statuette
by
clodion
,
and
beside
it
lay
a
copy
of
"
_
les
cent
nouvelles
_
,
"
bound
for
margaret
of
valois
by
clovis
eve
,
and
powdered
with
the
gilt
daisies
that
queen
had
selected
for
her
device
.
some
large
blue
china
jars
and
parrot
-
tulips
were
ranged
on
the
mantel
-
shelf
,
and
through
the
small
leaded
panels
of
the
window
streamed
the
apricot
-
coloured
light
of
a
summer
day
in
london
.
lord
henry
had
not
yet
come
in
.
he
was
always
late
on
principle
,
his
principle
being
that
punctuality
is
the
thief
of
time
.
so
the
lad
was
looking
rather
sulky
,
as
with
listless
fingers
he
turned
over
the
pages
of
an
elaborately
-
illustrated
edition
of
"
_
manon
lescaut
_
"
that
he
had
found
in
one
of
the
bookcases
.
the
formal
monotonous
ticking
of
the
louis
quatorze
clock
annoyed
him
.
once
or
twice
he
thought
of
going
away
.
at
last
he
heard
a
step
outside
,
and
the
door
opened
.
"
how
late
you
are
,
harry
!
"
he
murmured
.
"
i
am
afraid
it
is
not
harry
,
mr
.
gray
,
"
answered
a
shrill
voice
.
he
glanced
quickly
round
,
and
rose
to
his
feet
.
"
i
beg
your
pardon
.
i
thought
-
-
-
-
"
"
you
thought
it
was
my
husband
.
it
is
only
his
wife
.
you
must
let
me
introduce
myself
.
i
know
you
quite
well
by
your
photographs
.
i
think
my
husband
has
got
seventeen
of
them
.
"
"
not
seventeen
,
lady
henry
?
"
"
well
,
eighteen
,
then
.
and
i
saw
you
with
him
the
other
night
at
the
opera
.
"
she
laughed
nervously
as
she
spoke
,
and
watched
him
with
her
vague
forget
-
me
-
not
eyes
.
she
was
a
curious
woman
,
whose
dresses
always
looked
as
if
they
had
been
designed
in
a
rage
and
put
on
in
a
tempest
.
she
was
usually
in
love
with
somebody
,
and
,
as
her
passion
was
never
returned
,
she
had
kept
all
her
illusions
.
she
tried
to
look
picturesque
,
but
only
succeeded
in
being
untidy
.
her
name
was
victoria
,
and
she
had
a
perfect
mania
for
going
to
church
.
"
that
was
at
'
lohengrin
,
'
lady
henry
,
i
think
?
"
"
yes
;
it
was
at
dear
'
lohengrin
.
'
i
like
wagner
'
s
music
better
than
anybody
'
s
.
it
is
so
loud
that
one
can
talk
the
whole
time
without
other
people
hearing
what
one
says
.
that
is
a
great
advantage
:
don
'
t
you
think
so
,
mr
.
gray
?
"
the
same
nervous
staccato
laugh
broke
from
her
thin
lips
,
and
her
fingers
began
to
play
with
a
long
tortoise
-
shell
paper
-
knife
.
dorian
smiled
,
and
shook
his
head
:
"
i
am
afraid
i
don
'
t
think
so
,
lady
henry
.
i
never
talk
during
music
,
at
least
,
during
good
music
.
if
one
hears
bad
music
,
it
is
one
'
s
duty
to
drown
it
in
conversation
.
"
"
ah
!
that
is
one
of
harry
'
s
views
,
isn
'
t
it
,
mr
.
gray
?
i
always
hear
harry
'
s
views
from
his
friends
.
it
is
the
only
way
i
get
to
know
of
them
.
but
you
must
not
think
i
don
'
t
like
good
music
.
i
adore
it
,
but
i
am
afraid
of
it
.
it
makes
me
too
romantic
.
i
have
simply
worshipped
pianists
-
-
two
at
a
time
,
sometimes
,
harry
tells
me
.
i
don
'
t
know
what
it
is
about
them
.
perhaps
it
is
that
they
are
foreigners
.
they
all
are
,
ain
'
t
they
?
even
those
that
are
born
in
england
become
foreigners
after
a
time
,
don
'
t
they
?
it
is
so
clever
of
them
,
and
such
a
compliment
to
art
.
makes
it
quite
cosmopolitan
,
doesn
'
t
it
?
you
have
never
been
to
any
of
my
parties
,
have
you
,
mr
.
gray
?
you
must
come
.
i
can
'
t
afford
orchids
,
but
i
spare
no
expense
in
foreigners
.
they
make
one
'
s
rooms
look
so
picturesque
.
but
here
is
harry
!
-
-
harry
,
i
came
in
to
look
for
you
,
to
ask
you
something
-
-
i
forget
what
it
was
-
-
and
i
found
mr
.
gray
here
.
we
have
had
such
a
pleasant
chat
about
music
.
we
have
quite
the
same
ideas
.
no
;
i
think
our
ideas
are
quite
different
.
but
he
has
been
most
pleasant
.
i
am
so
glad
i
'
ve
seen
him
.
"
"
i
am
charmed
,
my
love
,
quite
charmed
,
"
said
lord
henry
,
elevating
his
dark
crescent
-
shaped
eyebrows
and
looking
at
them
both
with
an
amused
smile
.
"
so
sorry
i
am
late
,
dorian
.
i
went
to
look
after
a
piece
of
old
brocade
in
wardour
street
,
and
had
to
bargain
for
hours
for
it
.
nowadays
people
know
the
price
of
everything
,
and
the
value
of
nothing
.
"
"
i
am
afraid
i
must
be
going
,
"
exclaimed
lady
henry
,
breaking
an
awkward
silence
with
her
silly
sudden
laugh
.
"
i
have
promised
to
drive
with
the
duchess
.
good
-
bye
,
mr
.
gray
.
good
-
bye
,
harry
.
you
are
dining
out
,
i
suppose
?
so
am
i
.
perhaps
i
shall
see
you
at
lady
thornbury
'
s
.
"
"
i
daresay
,
my
dear
,
"
said
lord
henry
,
shutting
the
door
behind
her
,
as
,
looking
like
a
bird
of
paradise
that
had
been
out
all
night
in
the
rain
,
she
flitted
out
of
the
room
,
leaving
a
faint
odour
of
frangipanni
.
then
he
lit
a
cigarette
,
and
flung
himself
down
on
the
sofa
.
"
never
marry
a
woman
with
straw
-
coloured
hair
,
dorian
,
"
he
said
,
after
a
few
puffs
.
"
why
,
harry
?
"
"
because
they
are
so
sentimental
.
"
"
but
i
like
sentimental
people
.
"
"
never
marry
at
all
,
dorian
.
men
marry
because
they
are
tired
;
women
,
because
they
are
curious
;
both
are
disappointed
.
"
"
i
don
'
t
think
i
am
likely
to
marry
,
henry
.
i
am
too
much
in
love
.
that
is
one
of
your
aphorisms
.
i
am
putting
it
into
practice
,
as
i
do
everything
that
you
say
.
"
"
who
are
you
in
love
with
?
"
asked
lord
henry
,
after
a
pause
.
"
with
an
actress
,
"
said
dorian
gray
,
blushing
.
lord
henry
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
"
that
is
a
rather
commonplace
_
d
but
_
.
"
"
you
would
not
say
so
if
you
saw
her
,
harry
.
"
"
who
is
she
?
"
"
her
name
is
sibyl
vane
.
"
"
never
heard
of
her
.
"
"
no
one
has
.
people
will
some
day
,
however
.
she
is
a
genius
.
"
"
my
dear
boy
,
no
woman
is
a
genius
.
women
are
a
decorative
sex
.
they
never
have
anything
to
say
,
but
they
say
it
charmingly
.
women
represent
the
triumph
of
matter
over
mind
,
just
as
men
represent
the
triumph
of
mind
over
morals
.
"
"
harry
,
how
can
you
?
"
"
my
dear
dorian
,
it
is
quite
true
.
i
am
analysing
women
at
the
present
,
so
i
ought
to
know
.
the
subject
is
not
so
abstruse
as
i
thought
it
was
.
i
find
that
,
ultimately
,
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
women
,
the
plain
and
the
coloured
.
the
plain
women
are
very
useful
.
if
you
want
to
gain
a
reputation
for
respectability
,
you
have
merely
to
take
them
down
to
supper
.
the
other
women
are
very
charming
.
they
commit
one
mistake
,
however
.
they
paint
in
order
to
try
and
look
young
.
our
grandmothers
painted
in
order
to
try
and
talk
brilliantly
.
_
rouge
_
and
_
esprit
_
used
to
go
together
.
that
is
all
over
now
.
as
long
as
a
woman
can
look
ten
years
younger
than
her
own
daughter
,
she
is
perfectly
satisfied
.
as
for
conversation
,
there
are
only
five
women
in
london
worth
talking
to
,
and
two
of
these
can
'
t
be
admitted
into
decent
society
.
however
,
tell
me
about
your
genius
.
how
long
have
you
known
her
?
"
"
ah
!
harry
,
your
views
terrify
me
.
"
"
never
mind
that
.
how
long
have
you
known
her
?
"
"
about
three
weeks
.
"
"
and
where
did
you
come
across
her
?
"
"
i
will
tell
you
,
harry
;
but
you
mustn
'
t
be
unsympathetic
about
it
.
after
all
,
it
never
would
have
happened
if
i
had
not
met
you
.
you
filled
me
with
a
wild
desire
to
know
everything
about
life
.
for
days
after
i
met
you
,
something
seemed
to
throb
in
my
veins
.
as
i
lounged
in
the
park
,
or
strolled
down
piccadilly
,
i
used
to
look
at
every
one
who
passed
me
,
and
wonder
,
with
a
mad
curiosity
,
what
sort
of
lives
they
led
.
some
of
them
fascinated
me
.
others
filled
me
with
terror
.
there
was
an
exquisite
poison
in
the
air
.
i
had
a
passion
for
sensations
.
.
.
.
well
,
one
evening
about
seven
o
'
clock
,
i
determined
to
go
out
in
search
of
some
adventure
.
i
felt
that
this
grey
,
monstrous
london
of
ours
,
with
its
myriads
of
people
,
its
sordid
sinners
,
and
its
splendid
sins
,
as
you
once
phrased
it
,
must
have
something
in
store
for
me
.
i
fancied
a
thousand
things
.
the
mere
danger
gave
me
a
sense
of
delight
.
i
remembered
what
you
had
said
to
me
on
that
wonderful
evening
when
we
first
dined
together
,
about
the
search
for
beauty
being
the
real
secret
of
life
.
i
don
'
t
know
what
i
expected
,
but
i
went
out
and
wandered
eastward
,
soon
losing
my
way
in
a
labyrinth
of
grimy
streets
and
black
,
grassless
squares
.
about
half
-
past
eight
i
passed
by
an
absurd
little
theatre
,
with
great
flaring
gas
-
jets
and
gaudy
play
-
bills
.
a
hideous
jew
,
in
the
most
amazing
waistcoat
i
ever
beheld
in
my
life
,
was
standing
at
the
entrance
,
smoking
a
vile
cigar
.
he
had
greasy
ringlets
,
and
an
enormous
diamond
blazed
in
the
centre
of
a
soiled
shirt
.
'
have
a
box
,
my
lord
?
'
he
said
,
when
he
saw
me
,
and
he
took
off
his
hat
with
an
air
of
gorgeous
servility
.
there
was
something
about
him
,
harry
,
that
amused
me
.
he
was
such
a
monster
.
you
will
laugh
at
me
,
i
know
,
but
i
really
went
in
and
paid
a
whole
guinea
for
the
stage
-
box
.
to
the
present
day
i
can
'
t
make
out
why
i
did
so
;
and
yet
if
i
hadn
'
t
-
-
my
dear
harry
,
if
i
hadn
'
t
,
i
should
have
missed
the
greatest
romance
of
my
life
.
i
see
you
are
laughing
.
it
is
horrid
of
you
!
"
"
i
am
not
laughing
,
dorian
;
at
least
i
am
not
laughing
at
you
.
but
you
should
not
say
the
greatest
romance
of
your
life
.
you
should
say
the
first
romance
of
your
life
.
you
will
always
be
loved
,
and
you
will
always
be
in
love
with
love
.
a
_
grande
passion
_
is
the
privilege
of
people
who
have
nothing
to
do
.
that
is
the
one
use
of
the
idle
classes
of
a
country
.
don
'
t
be
afraid
.
there
are
exquisite
things
in
store
for
you
.
this
is
merely
the
beginning
.
"
"
do
you
think
my
nature
so
shallow
?
"
cried
dorian
gray
,
angrily
.
"
no
;
i
think
your
nature
so
deep
.
"
"
how
do
you
mean
?
"
"
my
dear
boy
,
the
people
who
love
only
once
in
their
lives
are
really
the
shallow
people
.
what
they
call
their
loyalty
,
and
their
fidelity
,
i
call
either
the
lethargy
of
custom
or
their
lack
of
imagination
.
faithfulness
is
to
the
emotional
life
what
consistency
is
to
the
life
of
the
intellect
-
-
simply
a
confession
of
failures
.
faithfulness
!
i
must
analyse
it
some
day
.
the
passion
for
property
is
in
it
.
there
are
many
things
that
we
would
throw
away
if
we
were
not
afraid
that
others
might
pick
them
up
.
but
i
don
'
t
want
to
interrupt
you
.
go
on
with
your
story
.
"
"
well
,
i
found
myself
seated
in
a
horrid
little
private
box
,
with
a
vulgar
drop
-
scene
staring
me
in
the
face
.
i
looked
out
from
behind
the
curtain
,
and
surveyed
the
house
.
it
was
a
tawdry
affair
,
all
cupids
and
cornucopias
,
like
a
third
-
rate
wedding
cake
.
the
gallery
and
pit
were
fairy
full
,
but
the
two
rows
of
dingy
stalls
were
quite
empty
,
and
there
was
hardly
a
person
in
what
i
suppose
they
called
the
dress
-
circle
.
women
went
about
with
oranges
and
ginger
-
beer
,
and
there
was
a
terrible
consumption
of
nuts
going
on
.
"
"
it
must
have
been
just
like
the
palmy
days
of
the
british
drama
.
"
"
just
like
,
i
should
fancy
,
and
very
depressing
.
i
began
to
wonder
what
on
earth
i
should
do
,
when
i
caught
sight
of
the
play
-
bill
.
what
do
you
think
the
play
was
,
harry
?
"
"
i
should
think
'
the
idiot
boy
,
or
dumb
but
innocent
.
'
our
fathers
used
to
like
that
sort
of
piece
,
i
believe
.
the
longer
i
live
,
dorian
,
the
more
keenly
i
feel
that
whatever
was
good
enough
for
our
fathers
is
not
good
enough
for
us
.
in
art
,
as
in
politics
,
_
les
grandp
res
ont
toujours
tort
_
.
"
"
this
play
was
good
enough
for
us
,
harry
.
it
was
'
romeo
and
juliet
.
'
i
must
admit
that
i
was
rather
annoyed
at
the
idea
of
seeing
shakespeare
done
in
such
a
wretched
hole
of
a
place
.
still
,
i
felt
interested
,
in
a
sort
of
way
.
at
any
rate
,
i
determined
to
wait
for
the
first
act
.
there
was
a
dreadful
orchestra
,
presided
over
by
a
young
hebrew
who
sat
at
a
cracked
piano
,
that
nearly
drove
me
away
,
but
at
last
the
drop
-
scene
was
drawn
up
,
and
the
play
began
.
romeo
was
a
stout
elderly
gentleman
,
with
corked
eyebrows
,
a
husky
tragedy
voice
,
and
a
figure
like
a
beer
-
barrel
.
mercutio
was
almost
as
bad
.
he
was
played
by
the
low
-
comedian
,
who
had
introduced
gags
of
his
own
and
was
on
most
friendly
terms
with
the
pit
.
they
were
both
as
grotesque
as
the
scenery
,
and
that
looked
as
if
it
had
come
out
of
a
country
-
booth
.
but
juliet
!
harry
,
imagine
a
girl
,
hardly
seventeen
years
of
age
,
with
a
little
flower
-
like
face
,
a
small
greek
head
with
plaited
coils
of
dark
-
brown
hair
,
eyes
that
were
violet
wells
of
passion
,
lips
that
were
like
the
petals
of
a
rose
.
she
was
the
loveliest
thing
i
had
ever
seen
in
my
life
.
you
said
to
me
once
that
pathos
left
you
unmoved
,
but
that
beauty
,
mere
beauty
,
could
fill
your
eyes
with
tears
.
i
tell
you
,
harry
,
i
could
hardly
see
this
girl
for
the
mist
of
tears
that
came
across
me
.
and
her
voice
-
-
i
never
heard
such
a
voice
.
it
was
very
low
at
first
,
with
deep
mellow
notes
,
that
seemed
to
fall
singly
upon
one
'
s
ear
.
then
it
became
a
little
louder
,
and
sounded
like
a
flute
or
a
distant
hautbois
.
in
the
garden
-
scene
it
had
all
the
tremulous
ecstasy
that
one
hears
just
before
dawn
when
nightingales
are
singing
.
there
were
moments
,
later
on
,
when
it
had
the
wild
passion
of
violins
.
you
know
how
a
voice
can
stir
one
.
your
voice
and
the
voice
of
sibyl
vane
are
two
things
that
i
shall
never
forget
.
when
i
close
my
eyes
,
i
hear
them
,
and
each
of
them
says
something
different
.
i
don
'
t
know
which
to
follow
.
why
should
i
not
love
her
?
harry
,
i
do
love
her
.
she
is
everything
to
me
in
life
.
night
after
night
i
go
to
see
her
play
.
one
evening
she
is
rosalind
,
and
the
next
evening
she
is
imogen
.
i
have
seen
her
die
in
the
gloom
of
an
italian
tomb
,
sucking
the
poison
from
her
lover
'
s
lips
.
i
have
watched
her
wandering
through
the
forest
of
arden
,
disguised
as
a
pretty
boy
in
hose
and
doublet
and
dainty
cap
.
she
has
been
mad
,
and
has
come
into
the
presence
of
a
guilty
king
,
and
given
him
rue
to
wear
,
and
bitter
herbs
to
taste
of
.
she
has
been
innocent
,
and
the
black
hands
of
jealousy
have
crushed
her
reed
-
like
throat
.
i
have
seen
her
in
every
age
and
in
every
costume
.
ordinary
women
never
appeal
to
one
'
s
imagination
.
they
are
limited
to
their
century
.
no
glamour
ever
transfigures
them
.
one
knows
their
minds
as
easily
as
one
knows
their
bonnets
.
one
can
always
find
them
.
there
is
no
mystery
in
any
of
them
.
they
ride
in
the
park
in
the
morning
,
and
chatter
at
tea
-
parties
in
the
afternoon
.
they
have
their
stereotyped
smile
,
and
their
fashionable
manner
.
they
are
quite
obvious
.
but
an
actress
!
how
different
an
actress
is
!
harry
!
why
didn
'
t
you
tell
me
that
the
only
thing
worth
loving
is
an
actress
?
"
"
because
i
have
loved
so
many
of
them
,
dorian
.
"
"
oh
,
yes
,
horrid
people
with
dyed
hair
and
painted
faces
.
"
"
don
'
t
run
down
dyed
hair
and
painted
faces
.
there
is
an
extraordinary
charm
in
them
,
sometimes
,
"
said
lord
henry
.
"
i
wish
now
i
had
not
told
you
about
sibyl
vane
.
"
"
you
could
not
have
helped
telling
me
,
dorian
.
all
through
your
life
you
will
tell
me
everything
you
do
.
"
"
yes
,
harry
,
i
believe
that
is
true
.
i
cannot
help
telling
you
things
.
you
have
a
curious
influence
over
me
.
if
i
ever
did
a
crime
,
i
would
come
and
confess
it
to
you
.
you
would
understand
me
.
"
"
people
like
you
-
-
the
wilful
sunbeams
of
life
-
-
don
'
t
commit
crimes
,
dorian
.
but
i
am
much
obliged
for
the
compliment
,
all
the
same
.
and
now
tell
me
-
-
reach
me
the
matches
,
like
a
good
boy
:
thanks
:
-
-
what
are
your
actual
relations
with
sibyl
vane
?
"
dorian
gray
leaped
to
his
feet
,
with
flushed
cheeks
and
burning
eyes
.
"
harry
!
sibyl
vane
is
sacred
!
"
"
it
is
only
the
sacred
things
that
are
worth
touching
,
dorian
,
"
said
lord
henry
,
with
a
strange
touch
of
pathos
in
his
voice
.
"
but
why
should
you
be
annoyed
?
i
suppose
she
will
belong
to
you
some
day
.
when
one
is
in
love
,
one
always
begins
by
deceiving
one
'
s
self
,
and
one
always
ends
by
deceiving
others
.
that
is
what
the
world
calls
a
romance
.
you
know
her
,
at
any
rate
,
i
suppose
?
"
"
of
course
i
know
her
.
on
the
first
night
i
was
at
the
theatre
,
the
horrid
old
jew
came
round
to
the
box
after
the
performance
was
over
,
and
offered
to
take
me
behind
the
scenes
and
introduce
me
to
her
.
i
was
furious
with
him
,
and
told
him
that
juliet
had
been
dead
for
hundreds
of
years
,
and
that
her
body
was
lying
in
a
marble
tomb
in
verona
.
i
think
,
from
his
blank
look
of
amazement
,
that
he
was
under
the
impression
that
i
had
taken
too
much
champagne
,
or
something
.
"
"
i
am
not
surprised
.
"
"
then
he
asked
me
if
i
wrote
for
any
of
the
newspapers
.
i
told
him
i
never
even
read
them
.
he
seemed
terribly
disappointed
at
that
,
and
confided
to
me
that
all
the
dramatic
critics
were
in
a
conspiracy
against
him
,
and
that
they
were
every
one
of
them
to
be
bought
.
"
"
i
should
not
wonder
if
he
was
quite
right
there
.
but
,
on
the
other
hand
,
judging
from
their
appearance
,
most
of
them
cannot
be
at
all
expensive
.
"
"
well
,
he
seemed
to
think
they
were
beyond
his
means
,
"
laughed
dorian
.
"
by
this
time
,
however
,
the
lights
were
being
put
out
in
the
theatre
,
and
i
had
to
go
.
he
wanted
me
to
try
some
cigars
that
he
strongly
recommended
.
i
declined
.
the
next
night
,
of
course
,
i
arrived
at
the
place
again
.
when
he
saw
me
he
made
me
a
low
bow
,
and
assured
me
that
i
was
a
munificent
patron
of
art
.
he
was
a
most
offensive
brute
,
though
he
had
an
extraordinary
passion
for
shakespeare
.
he
told
me
once
,
with
an
air
of
pride
,
that
his
five
bankruptcies
were
entirely
due
to
'
the
bard
,
'
as
he
insisted
on
calling
him
.
he
seemed
to
think
it
a
distinction
.
"
"
it
was
a
distinction
,
my
dear
dorian
-
-
a
great
distinction
.
most
people
become
bankrupt
through
having
invested
too
heavily
in
the
prose
of
life
.
to
have
ruined
one
'
s
self
over
poetry
is
an
honour
.
but
when
did
you
first
speak
to
miss
sibyl
vane
?
"
"
the
third
night
.
she
had
been
playing
rosalind
.
i
could
not
help
going
round
.
i
had
thrown
her
some
flowers
,
and
she
had
looked
at
me
;
at
least
i
fancied
that
she
had
.
the
old
jew
was
persistent
.
he
seemed
determined
to
take
me
behind
,
so
i
consented
.
it
was
curious
my
not
wanting
to
know
her
,
wasn
'
t
it
?
"
"
no
;
i
don
'
t
think
so
.
"
"
my
dear
harry
,
why
?
"
"
i
will
tell
you
some
other
time
.
now
i
want
to
know
about
the
girl
.
"
"
sibyl
?
oh
,
she
was
so
shy
,
and
so
gentle
.
there
is
something
of
a
child
about
her
.
her
eyes
opened
wide
in
exquisite
wonder
when
i
told
her
what
i
thought
of
her
performance
,
and
she
seemed
quite
unconscious
of
her
power
.
i
think
we
were
both
rather
nervous
.
the
old
jew
stood
grinning
at
the
doorway
of
the
dusty
greenroom
,
making
elaborate
speeches
about
us
both
,
while
we
stood
looking
at
each
other
like
children
.
he
would
insist
on
calling
me
'
my
lord
,
'
so
i
had
to
assure
sibyl
that
i
was
not
anything
of
the
kind
.
she
said
quite
simply
to
me
,
'
you
look
more
like
a
prince
.
i
must
call
you
prince
charming
.
'
"
"
upon
my
word
,
dorian
,
miss
sibyl
knows
how
to
pay
compliments
.
"
"
you
don
'
t
understand
her
,
harry
.
she
regarded
me
merely
as
a
person
in
a
play
.
she
knows
nothing
of
life
.
she
lives
with
her
mother
,
a
faded
tired
woman
who
played
lady
capulet
in
a
sort
of
magenta
dressing
-
wrapper
on
the
first
night
,
and
looks
as
if
she
had
seen
better
days
.
"
"
i
know
that
look
.
it
depresses
me
,
"
murmured
lord
henry
,
examining
his
rings
.
"
the
jew
wanted
to
tell
me
her
history
,
but
i
said
it
did
not
interest
me
.
"
"
you
were
quite
right
.
there
is
always
something
infinitely
mean
about
other
people
'
s
tragedies
.
"
"
sibyl
is
the
only
thing
i
care
about
.
what
is
it
to
me
where
she
came
from
?
from
her
little
head
to
her
little
feet
,
she
is
absolutely
and
entirely
divine
.
every
night
of
my
life
i
go
to
see
her
act
,
and
every
night
she
is
more
marvellous
.
"
"
that
is
the
reason
,
i
suppose
,
that
you
never
dine
with
me
now
.
i
thought
you
must
have
some
curious
romance
on
hand
.
you
have
;
but
it
is
not
quite
what
i
expected
.
"
"
my
dear
harry
,
we
either
lunch
or
sup
together
every
day
,
and
i
have
been
to
the
opera
with
you
several
times
,
"
said
dorian
,
opening
his
blue
eyes
in
wonder
.
"
you
always
come
dreadfully
late
.
"
"
well
,
i
can
'
t
help
going
to
see
sibyl
play
,
"
he
cried
,
"
even
if
it
is
only
for
a
single
act
.
i
get
hungry
for
her
presence
;
and
when
i
think
of
the
wonderful
soul
that
is
hidden
away
in
that
little
ivory
body
,
i
am
filled
with
awe
.
"
"
you
can
dine
with
me
to
-
night
,
dorian
,
can
'
t
you
?
"
he
shook
his
head
.
"
to
-
night
she
is
imogen
,
"
he
answered
,
"
and
to
-
morrow
night
she
will
be
juliet
.
"
"
when
is
she
sibyl
vane
?
"
"
never
.
"
"
i
congratulate
you
.
"
"
how
horrid
you
are
!
she
is
all
the
great
heroines
of
the
world
in
one
.
she
is
more
than
an
individual
.
you
laugh
,
but
i
tell
you
she
has
genius
.
i
love
her
,
and
i
must
make
her
love
me

you
,
who
know
all
the
secrets
of
life
,
tell
me
how
to
charm
sibyl
vane
to
love
me
!
i
want
to
make
romeo
jealous
.
i
want
the
dead
lovers
of
the
world
to
hear
our
laughter
,
and
grow
sad
.
i
want
a
breath
of
our
passion

stir
their
dust
into
consciousness

to
wake
their
ashes
into
pain

my
god
,
harry

how
i
worship
her

"
he
was
walking
up
and
down
the
room
as
he
spoke
.
hectic
spots
of
red
burned
on
his
cheeks
.
he
was
terribly
excited
.
lord
henry
watched
him
with
a
subtle
sense
of
pleasure

how
different
he
was
now
from
the
shy
,
frightened
boy
he
had
met
in
basil
hallward

studio
!
his
nature
had
developed
like
a
flower
,
had
borne
blossoms
of
scarlet
flame
.
out
of
its
secret
hiding
-
place
had
crept
his
soul
,
and
desire
had
come
to
meet
it
on
the
way
.
"
and
what
do
you
propose
to
do
?
"
said
lord
henry
,
at
last

"
i
want
you
and
basil
to
come
with
me
some
night

see
her
act

i
have
not

slightest
fear
of
the
result

you
are
certain

acknowledge
her
genius

then
we
must

out

him

"
dear
basil
!
i
have
not
laid
eyes
on
him
for
a
week
.
it
is
rather
horrid
of
me
,
as
he
has
sent
me
my
portrait
in
the
most
wonderful
frame
,
specially
designed
by
himself
,
and
,
though
i
am
a
little
jealous
of
the
picture
for
being
a
whole
month
younger
than
i
am
,
i
must
admit
that
i
delight
in
it
.
perhaps
you
had
better
write
to
him
.
i
don
'
t
want
to
see
him
alone
.
he
says
things
that
annoy
me

he
gives
me
good
advice

"
people
are
very
fond
of
giving
away
what
they
need
most
themselves
.
it
is
what
i
call
the
depth
of
generosity
.
"
"
oh
,
basil
is
the
best
of
fellows
,
but
he
seems
to
me
to
be
just
a
bit
of
a
philistine
.
since
i
have
known
you
,
harry
,
i
have
discovered
that
.
"
"
basil
,
my
dear
boy
,
puts
everything
that
is
charming
in
him
into
his
work
.
the
consequence
is
that
he
has
nothing
left
for
life
but
his
prejudices
,
his
principles
,
and
his
common
-
sense
.
the
only
artists
i
have
ever
known
,
who
are
personally
delightful
,
are
bad
artists
.
good
artists
exist
simply
in
what
they
make
,
and
consequently
are
perfectly
uninteresting
in
what
they
are
.
a
great
poet
,
a
really
great
poet
,
is
the
most
unpoetical
of
all
creatures
.
but
inferior
poets
are
absolutely
fascinating
.
the
worse
their
rhymes
are
,
the
more
picturesque
they
look
.
the
mere
fact
of
having
published
a
book
of
second
-
rate
sonnets
makes
a
man
quite
irresistible
.
he
lives
the
poetry
that
he
cannot
write
.
the
others
write
the
poetry
that
they
dare
not
realise
.

wonder
is
that
really

dorian

,
putting
some
perfume
on
his
handkerchief
out
of

bottle
that
stood
on

"
as
he
left
the
room
,
lord
henry
'
s
heavy
eyelids
drooped
,
and
he
began
to
think
.
certainly
few
people
had
ever
interested
him
so
much
as
dorian
gray
,
and
yet
the
lad
'
s
mad
adoration
of
some
one
else
caused
him
not
the
slightest
pang
of
annoyance
or
jealousy
.
he
was
pleased
by
it
.
it
made
him
a
more
interesting
study
.
he
had
been
always
enthralled
by
the
methods
of
natural
science
,
but
the
ordinary
subject
-
matter
of
that
science
had
seemed
to
him
trivial
and
of
no
import
.
and
so
he
had
begun
by
vivisecting
himself
,
as
he
had
ended
by
vivisecting
others
.
human
life
-
-
that
appeared
to
him
the
one
thing
worth
investigating
.
compared
to
it
there
was
nothing
else
of
any
value
.
it
was
true
that
as
one
watched
life
in
its
curious
crucible
of
pain
and
pleasure
,
one
could
not
wear
over
one
'
s
face
a
mask
of
glass
,
nor
keep
the
sulphurous
fumes
from
troubling
the
brain
,
and
making
the
imagination
turbid
with
monstrous
fancies
and
misshapen
dreams
.
there
were
poisons
so
subtle
that
to
know
their
properties
one
had
to
sicken
of
them
.
there
were
maladies
so
strange
that
one
had
to
pass
through
them
if
one
sought
to
understand
their
nature
.
and
,
yet
,
what
a
great
reward
one
received
!
how
wonderful
the
whole
world
became
to
one
!
to
note
the
curious
hard
logic
of
passion
,
and
the
emotional
coloured
life
of
the
intellect
-
-
to
observe
where
they
met
,
and
where
they
separated
,
at
what
point
they
were
in
unison
,
and
at
what
point
they
were
at
discord
-
-
there
was
a
delight
in
that
!
what
matter
what
the
cost
was
?
one
could
never
pay
too
high
a
price
for
any
sensation
.
he
was
conscious
-
-
and
the
thought
brought
a
gleam
of
pleasure
into
his
brown
agate
eyes
-
-
that
it
was
through
certain
words
of
his
,
musical
words
said
with
musical
utterance
,
that
dorian
gray
'
s
soul
had
turned
to
this
white
girl
and
bowed
in
worship
before
her
.
to
a
large
extent
the
lad
was
his
own
creation
.
he
had
made
him
premature
.
that
was
something
.
ordinary
people
waited
till
life
disclosed
to
them
its
secrets
,
but
to
the
few
,
to
the
elect
,
the
mysteries
of
life
were
revealed
before
the
veil
was
drawn
away
.
sometimes
this
was
the
effect
of
art
,
and
chiefly
of
the
art
of
literature
,
which
dealt
immediately
with
the
passions
and
the
intellect
.
but
now
and
then
a
complex
personality
took
the
place
and
assumed
the
office
of
art
;
was
indeed
,
in
its
way
,
a
real
work
of
art
,
life
having
its
elaborate
masterpieces
,
just
as
poetry
has
,
or
sculpture
,
or
painting
.
yes
,
the
lad
was
premature
.
he
was
gathering
his
harvest
while
it
was
yet
spring
.
the
pulse
and
passion
of
youth
were
in
him
,
but
he
was
becoming
self
-
conscious
.
it
was
delightful
to
watch
him
.
with
his
beautiful
face
,
and
his
beautiful
soul
,
he
was
a
thing
to
wonder
at
.
it
was
no
matter
how
it
all
ended
,
or
was
destined
to
end
.
he
was
like
one
of
those
gracious
figures
in
a
pageant
or
a
play
,
whose
joys
seem
to
be
remote
from
one
,
but
whose
sorrows
stir
one
'
s
sense
of
beauty
,
and
whose
wounds
are
like
red
roses
.
soul
and
body
,
body
and
soul
-
-
how
mysterious
they
were
!
there
was
animalism
in
the
soul
,
and
the
body
had
its
moments
of
spirituality
.
the
senses
could
refine
,
and
the
intellect
could
degrade
.
who
could
say
where
the
fleshly
impulse
ceased
,
or
the
physical
impulse
began
?
how
shallow
were
the
arbitrary
definitions
of
ordinary
psychologists
!
and
yet
how
difficult
to
decide
between
the
claims
of
the
various
schools
!
was
the
soul
a
shadow
seated
in
the
house
of
sin
?
or
was
the
body
really
in
the
soul
,
as
giordano
bruno
thought
?
the
separation
of
spirit
from
matter
was
a
mystery
,
and
the
union
of
spirit
with
matter
was
a
mystery
also
.
he
began
to
wonder
whether
we
could
ever
make
psychology
so
absolute
a
science
that
each
little
spring
of
life
would
be
revealed
to
us
.
as
it
was
,
we
always
misunderstood
ourselves
,
and
rarely
understood
others
.
experience
was
of
no
ethical
value
.
it
was
merely
the
name
men
gave
to
their
mistakes
.
moralists
had
,
as
a
rule
,
regarded
it
as
a
mode
of
warning
,
had
claimed
for
it
a
certain
ethical
efficacy
in
the
formation
of
character
,
had
praised
it
as
something
that
taught
us
what
to
follow
and
showed
us
what
to
avoid
.
but
there
was
no
motive
power
in
experience
.
it
was
as
little
of
an
active
cause
as
conscience
itself
.
all
that
it
really
demonstrated
was
that
our
future
would
be
the
same
as
our
past
,
and
that
the
sin
we
had
done
once
,
and
with
loathing
,
we
would
do
many
times
,
and
with
joy
.
it
was
clear
to
him
that
the
experimental
method
was
the
only
method
by
which
one
could
arrive
at
any
scientific
analysis
of
the
passions
;
and
certainly
dorian
gray
was
a
subject
made
to
his
hand
,
and
seemed
to
promise
rich
and
fruitful
results
.
his
sudden
mad
love
for
sibyl
vane
was
a
psychological
phenomenon
of
no
small
interest
.
there
was
no
doubt
that
curiosity
had
much
to
do
with
it
,
curiosity
and
the
desire
for
new
experiences
;
yet
it
was
not
a
simple
but
rather
a
very
complex
passion
.
what
there
was
in
it
of
the
purely
sensuous
instinct
of
boyhood
had
been
transformed
by
the
workings
of
the
imagination
,
changed
into
something
that
seemed
to
the
lad
himself
to
be
remote
from
sense
,
and
was
for
that
very
reason
all
the
more
dangerous
.
it
was
the
passions
about
whose
origin
we
deceived
ourselves
that
tyrannised
most
strongly
over
us
.
our
weakest
motives
were
those
of
whose
nature
we
were
conscious
.
it
often
happened
that
when
we
thought
we
were
experimenting
on
others
we
were
really
experimenting
on
ourselves
.
while
lord
henry
sat
dreaming
on
these
things
,
a
knock
came
to
the
door
,
and
his
valet
entered
,
and
reminded
him
it
was
time
to
dress
for
dinner
.
he
got
up
and
looked
out
into
the
street
.
the
sunset
had
smitten
into
scarlet
gold
the
upper
windows
of
the
houses
opposite
.
the
panes
glowed
like
plates
of
heated
metal
.
the
sky
above
was
like
a
faded
rose
.
he
thought
of
his
friend
'
s
young
fiery
-
coloured
life
,
and
wondered
how
it
was
all
going
to
end
.
when
he
arrived
home
,
about
half
-
past
twelve
o
'
clock
,
he
saw
a
telegram
lying
on
the
hall
table
.
he
opened
it
,
and
found
it
was
from
dorian
gray
.
it
was
to
tell
him
that
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
sibyl
vane
.
chapter
v
"
mother
,
mother
,
i
am
so
happy

"
whispered
the
girl
,
burying
her
face
in
the
lap
of
the
faded
,
tired
-
looking
woman
who
,
with
back
turned
to
the
shrill
intrusive
light
,
was
sitting
in
the
one
arm
-
chair
that
their
dingy
sitting
-
room
contained
.
"
i
am
so
happy
!
"
she
repeated
,
"
and
you
must
be
happy
too
!
"
mrs
.
vane
winced
,
and
put
her
thin
bismuth
-
whitened
hands
on
her
daughter
'
s
head
.
"
happy
!
"
she
echoed
,
"
i
am
only
happy

,
when
i
see
you
act
.
you
must
not
think
of
anything
but
your
acting

mr
.
isaacs
has
been
very
good
to
us
,
and
we
owe
him
money
.
"
the
girl
looked
up
and
pouted
.
"
money
,
mother
?
"
she
cried
,
"
what
does
money
matter
?
love
is
more
than
money
.
"
"
mr
.
isaacs
has
advanced
us
fifty
pounds
to
pay
off
our
debts
,
and
to
get
a
proper
outfit
for
james
.
you
must
not
forget
that
,
sibyl
.
fifty
pounds
is
a
very
large
sum
.
mr
.
isaacs
has
been
most
considerate
.
"
"
he
is
not
a
gentleman
,
mother
,
and
i
hate
the
way
he
talks
to
me
,
"
said
the
girl
,
rising
to
her
feet
,
and
going
over
to
the
window
.
"
i
don
'
t
know
how
we
could
manage
without
him
,
"
answered
the
elder
woman
,
querulously
.
sibyl
vane
tossed
her
head
and
laughed
.
"
we
don
'
t
want
him
any
more
,
mother
.
prince
charming
rules
life
for
us
now
.
"
then
she
paused
.
a
rose
shook
in
her
blood
,
and
shadowed
her
cheeks
.
quick
breath
parted
the
petals
of
her
lips
.
they
trembled
.
some
southern
wind
of
passion
swept
over
her
,
and
stirred
the
dainty
folds
of
her
dress
.
"
i
love
him
,
"
she
said
,
simply
.
"
foolish
child
!
foolish
child
!
"
was
the
parrot
-
phrase
flung
in
answer
.
the
waving
of
crooked
,
false
-
jewelled
fingers
gave
grotesqueness
to
the
words
.
the
girl
laughed
again
.
the
joy
of
a
caged
bird
was
in
her
voice
.
her
eyes
caught
the
melody
,
and
echoed
it
in
radiance
;
then
closed
for
a
moment
,
as
though
to
hide
their
secret
.
when
they
opened
,
the
mist
of
a
dream
had
passed
across
them
.
thin
-
lipped
wisdom
spoke
at
her
from
the
worn
chair
,
hinted
at
prudence
,
quoted
from
that
book
of
cowardice
whose
author
apes
the
name
of
common
sense
.
she
did
not
listen
.
she
was
free
in
her
prison
of
passion
.
her
prince
,
prince
charming
,
was
with
her
.
she
had
called
on
memory
to
remake
him
.
she
had
sent
her
soul
to
search
for
him
,
and
it
had
brought
him
back
.
his
kiss
burned
again
upon
her
mouth
.
her
eyelids
were
warm
with
his
breath
.
then
wisdom
altered
its
method
and
spoke
of
espial
and
discovery
.
this
young
man
might
be
rich
.
if
so
,
marriage
should
be
thought
of
.
against
the
shell
of
her
ear
broke
the
waves
of
worldly
cunning
.
the
arrows
of
craft
shot
by
her
.
she
saw
the
thin
lips
moving
,
and
smiled
.
suddenly
she
felt
the
need
to
speak
.
the
wordy
silence
troubled
her
.
"
mother
,
mother
,
"
she
cried
,
"
why
does
he
love
me
so
much
?
i
know
why
i
love
him
.
i
love
him
because
he
is
like
what
love
himself
should
be
.
but
what
does
he
see
in
me
?
i
am
not
worthy
of
him
.
and
yet
-
-
why
,
i
cannot
tell
-
-
though
i
feel
so
much
beneath
him
,
i
don
'
t
feel
humble
.
i
feel
proud
,
terribly
proud
.
mother
,
did
you
love
my
father
as
i
love
prince
charming
?
"
the
elder
woman
grew
pale
beneath
the
coarse
powder
that
daubed
her
cheeks
,
and
her
dry
lips
twitched
with
a
spasm
of
pain
.
sibyl
rushed
to
her
,
flung
her
arms
round
her
neck
,
and
kissed
her
.
"
forgive
me
,
mother
.
i
know
it
pains
you
to
talk
about
our
father
.
but
it
only
pains
you
because
you
loved
him
so
much
.
don
'
t
look
so
sad
.
i
am
as
happy
to
-
day
as
you
were
twenty
years
ago
.
ah
!
let
me
be
happy
for
ever
!
"
"
my
child
,
you
are
far
too
young
to
think
of
falling
in
love
.
besides
,
what
do
you
know
of
this
young
man
?
you
don
'
t
even
know
his
name
.
the
whole
thing
is
most
inconvenient
,
and
really
,
when
james
is
going
away
to
australia
,
and
i
have
so
much
to
think
of
,
i
must
say
that
you
should
have
shown
more
consideration
.
however
,
as
i
said
before
,
if
he
is
rich
.
.
.
.
"
"
ah
!
mother
,
mother
,
let
me
be
happy
!
"
mrs
.
vane
glanced
at
her
,
and
with
one
of
those
false
theatrical
gestures
that
so
often
become
a
mode
of
second
nature
to
a
stage
-
player
,
clasped
her
in
her
arms
.
at
this
moment
the
door
opened
,
and
a
young
lad
with
rough
brown
hair
came
into
the
room
.
he
was
thick
-
set
of
figure
,
and
his
hands
and
feet
were
large
,
and
somewhat
clumsy
in
movement
.
he
was
not
so
finely
bred
as
his
sister
.
one
would
hardly
have
guessed
the
close
relationship
that
existed
between
them
.
mrs
.
vane
fixed
her
eyes
on
him
,
and
intensified
the
smile
.
she
mentally
elevated
her
son
to
the
dignity
of
an
audience
.
she
felt
sure
that
the
_
tableau
_
was
interesting
.
"
you
might
keep
some
of
your
kisses
for
me
,
sibyl
,
i
think
,
"
said
the
lad
,
with
a
good
-
natured
grumble
.
"
ah
!
but
you
don
'
t
like
being
kissed
,
jim
,
"
she
cried
.
"
you
are
a
dreadful
old
bear
.
"
and
she
ran
across
the
room
and
hugged
him
.
james
vane
looked
into
his
sister
'
s
face
with
tenderness
.
"
i
want
you
to
come
out
with
me
for
a
walk
,
sibyl
.
i
don
'
t
suppose
i
shall
ever
see
this
horrid
london
again
.
i
am
sure
i
don
'
t
want
to
.
"
"
my
son
,
don
'
t
say
such
dreadful
things
,
"
murmured
mrs
.
vane
,
taking
up
a
tawdry
theatrical
dress
,
with
a
sigh
,
and
beginning
to
patch
it
.
she
felt
a
little
disappointed
that
he
had
not
joined
the
group
.
it
would
have
increased
the
theatrical
picturesqueness
of
the
situation
.
"
why
not
,
mother
?
i
mean
it
.
"
"
you
pain
me
,
my
son
.
i
trust
you
will
return
from
australia
in
a
position
of
affluence
.
i
believe
there
is
no
society
of
any
kind
in
the
colonies
,
nothing
that
i
would
call
society
;
so
when
you
have
made
your
fortune
you
must
come
back
and
assert
yourself
in
london
.
"
"
society
!
"
muttered
the
lad
.
"
i
don
'
t
want
to
know
anything
about
that
.
i
should
like
to
make
some
money
to
take
you
and
sibyl
off
the
stage
.
i
hate
it
.
"
"
oh
,
jim
!
"
said
sibyl
,
laughing
,
"
how
unkind
of
you
!
but
are
you
really
going
for
a
walk
with
me
?
that
will
be
nice
!
i
was
afraid
you
were
going
to
say
good
-
bye
to
some
of
your
friends
-
-
to
tom
hardy
,
who
gave
you
that
hideous
pipe
,
or
ned
langton
,
who
makes
fun
of
you
for
smoking
it
.
it
is
very
sweet
of
you
to
let
me
have
your
last
afternoon
.
where
shall
we
go
?
let
us
go
to
the
park
.
"
"
i
am
too
shabby
,
"
he
answered
,
frowning
.
"
only
swell
people
go
to
the
park
.
"
"
nonsense
,
jim
,
"
she
whispered
,
stroking
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
.
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
.
"
very
well
,
"
he
said
at
last
,
"
but
don
'
t
be
too
long
dressing
.
"
she
danced
out
of
the
door
.
one
could
hear
her
singing
as
she
ran
upstairs
.
her
little
feet
pattered
overhead
.
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
two
or
three
times
.
then
he
turned
to
the
still
figure
in
the
chair
.
"
mother
,
are
my
things
ready
?
"
he
asked
.
"
quite
ready
,
james
,
"
she
answered
,
keeping
her
eyes
on
her
work
.
for
some
months
past
she
had
felt
ill
at
ease
when
she
was
alone
with
this
rough
,
stern
son
of
hers
.
her
shallow
secret
nature
was
troubled
when
their
eyes
met
.
she
used
to
wonder
if
he
suspected
anything
.
the
silence
,
for
he
made
no
other
observation
,
became
intolerable
to
her
.
she
began
to
complain
.
women
defend
themselves
by
attacking
,
just
as
they
attack
by
sudden
and
strange
surrenders
.
"
i
hope
you
will
be
contented
,
james
,
with
your
sea
-
faring
life
,
"
she
said
.
"
you
must
remember
that
it
is
your
own
choice
.
you
might
have
entered
a
solicitor
'
s
office
.
solicitors
are
a
very
respectable
class
,
and
in
the
country
often
dine
with
the
best
families
.
"
"
i
hate
offices
,
and
i
hate
clerks
,
"
he
replied
.
"
but
you
are
quite
right
.
i
have
chosen
my
own
life
.
all
i
say
is
,
watch
over
sibyl
.
don
'
t
let
her
come
to
any
harm
.
mother
,
you
must
watch
over
her
.
"
"
james
,
you
really
talk
very
strangely
.
of
course
i
watch
over
sibyl
.
"
"
i
hear
a
gentleman
comes
every
night
to
the
theatre
,
and
goes
behind
to
talk
to
her
.
is
that
right
?
what
about
that
?
"
"
you
are
speaking
about
things
you
don
'
t
understand
,
james
.
in
the
profession
we
are
accustomed
to
receive
a
great
deal
of
most
gratifying
attention
.
i
myself
used
to
receive
many
bouquets
at
one
time
.
that
was
when
acting
was
really
understood
.
as
for
sibyl
,
i
do
not
know
at
present
whether
her
attachment
is
serious
or
not
.
but
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
young
man
in
question
is
a
perfect
gentleman
.
he
is
always
most
polite
to
me
.
besides
,
he
has
the
appearance
of
being
rich
,
and
the
flowers
he
sends
are
lovely
.
"
"
you
don
'
t
know
his
name
,
though
,
"
said
the
lad
,
harshly
.
"
no
,
"
answered
his
mother
,
with
a
placid
expression
in
her
face
.
"
he
has
not
yet
revealed
his
real
name
.
i
think
it
is
quite
romantic
of
him
.
he
is
probably
a
member
of
the
aristocracy
.
"
james
vane
bit
his
lip
.
"
watch
over
sibyl
,
mother
,
"
he
cried
,
"
watch
over
her
.
"
"
my
son
,
you
distress
me
very
much
.
sibyl
is
always
under
my
special
care
.
of
course
,
if
this
gentleman
is
wealthy
,
there
is
no
reason
why
she
should
not
contract
an
alliance
with
him
.
i
trust
he
is
one
of
the
aristocracy
.
he
has
all
the
appearance
of
it
,
i
must
say
.
it
might
be
a
most
brilliant
marriage
for
sibyl
.
they
would
make
a
charming
couple
.
his
good
looks
are
really
quite
remarkable
;
everybody
notices
them
.
"
the
lad
muttered
something
to
himself
,
and
drummed
on
the
window
-
pane
with
his
coarse
fingers
.
he
had
just
turned
round
to
say
something
,
when
the
door
opened
,
and
sibyl
ran
in
.
"
how
serious
you
both
are
!
"
she
cried
.
"
what
is
the
matter
?
"
"
nothing
,
"
he
answered
.
"
i
suppose
one
must
be
serious
sometimes
.
good
-
bye
,
mother
;
i
will
have
my
dinner
at
five
o
'
clock
.
everything
is
packed
,
except
my
shirts
,
so
you
need
not
trouble
.
"
"
good
-
bye
,
my
son
,
"
she
answered
,
with
a
bow
of
strained
stateliness
.
she
was
extremely
annoyed
at
the
tone
he
had
adopted
with
her
,
and
there
was
something
in
his
look
that
had
made
her
feel
afraid
.
"
kiss
me
,
mother
,
"
said
the
girl
.
her
flower
-
like
lips
touched
the
withered
cheek
,
and
warmed
its
frost
.
"
my
child
!
my
child
!
"
cried
mrs
.
vane
,
looking
up
to
the
ceiling
in
search
of
an
imaginary
gallery
.
"
come
,
sibyl
,
"
said
her
brother
,
impatiently
.
he
hated
his
mother
'
s
affectations
.
they
went
out
into
the
flickering
wind
-
blown
sunlight
,
and
strolled
down
the
dreary
euston
road
.
the
passers
-
by
glanced
in
wonder
at
the
sullen
,
heavy
youth
,
who
,
in
coarse
,
ill
-
fitting
clothes
,
was
in
the
company
of
such
a
graceful
,
refined
-
looking
girl
.
he
was
like
a
common
gardener
walking
with
a
rose
.
jim
frowned
from
time
to
time
when
he
caught
the
inquisitive
glance
of
some
stranger
.
he
had
that
dislike
of
being
stared
at
which
comes
on
geniuses
late
in
life
,
and
never
leaves
the
commonplace
.
sibyl
,
however
,
was
quite
unconscious
of
the
effect
she
was
producing
.
her
love
was
trembling
in
laughter
on
her
lips
.
she
was
thinking
of
prince
charming
,
and
,
that
she
might
think
of
him
all
the
more
,
she
did
not
talk
of
him
but
prattled
on
about
the
ship
in
which
jim
was
going
to
sail
,
about
the
gold
he
was
certain
to
find
,
about
the
wonderful
heiress
whose
life
he
was
to
save
from
the
wicked
,
red
-
shirted
bushrangers
.
for
he
was
not
to
remain
a
sailor
,
or
a
super
-
cargo
,
or
whatever
he
was
going
to
be
.
oh
,
no
!
a
sailor
'
s
existence
was
dreadful
.
fancy
being
cooped
up
in
a
horrid
ship
,
with
the
hoarse
,
hump
-
backed
waves
trying
to
get
in
,
and
a
black
wind
blowing
the
masts
down
,
and
tearing
the
sails
into
long
screaming
ribands
!
he
was
to
leave
the
vessel
at
melbourne
,
bid
a
polite
good
-
bye
to
the
captain
,
and
go
off
at
once
to
the
gold
-
fields
.
before
a
week
was
over
he
was
to
come
across
a
large
nugget
of
pure
gold
,
the
largest
nugget
that
had
ever
been
discovered
,
and
bring
it
down
to
the
coast
in
a
waggon
guarded
by
six
mounted
policemen
.
the
bushrangers
were
to
attack
them
three
times
,
and
be
defeated
with
immense
slaughter
.
or
,
no
.
he
was
not
to
go
to
the
gold
-
fields
at
all
.
they
were
horrid
places
,
where
men
got
intoxicated
,
and
shot
each
other
in
bar
-
rooms
,
and
used
bad
language
.
he
was
to
be
a
nice
sheep
-
farmer
,
and
one
evening
,
as
he
was
riding
home
,
he
was
to
see
the
beautiful
heiress
being
carried
off
by
a
robber
on
a
black
horse
,
and
give
chase
,
and
rescue
her
.
of
course
she
would
fall
in
love
with
him
,
and
he
with
her
,
and
they
would
get
married
,
and
come
home
,
and
live
in
an
immense
house
in
london
.
yes
,
there
were
delightful
things
in
store
for
him
.
but
he
must
be
very
good
,
and
not
lose
his
temper
,
or
spend
his
money
foolishly
.
she
was
only
a
year
older
than
he
was
,
but
she
knew
so
much
more
of
life
.
he
must
be
sure
,
also
,
to
write
to
her
by
every
mail
,
and
to
say
his
prayers
each
night
before
he
went
to
sleep
.
god
was
very
good
,
and
would
watch
over
him
.
she
would
pray
for
him
,
too
,
and
in
a
few
years
he
would
come
back
quite
rich
and
happy
.
the
lad
listened
sulkily
to
her
,
and
made
no
answer
.
he
was
heart
-
sick
at
leaving
home
.
yet
it
was
not
this
alone
that
made
him
gloomy
and
morose
.
inexperienced
though
he
was
,
he
had
still
a
strong
sense
of
the
danger
of
sibyl
'
s
position
.
this
young
dandy
who
was
making
love
to
her
could
mean
her
no
good
.
he
was
a
gentleman
,
and
he
hated
him
for
that
,
hated
him
through
some
curious
race
-
instinct
for
which
he
could
not
account
,
and
which
for
that
reason
was
all
the
more
dominant
within
him
.
he
was
conscious
also
of
the
shallowness
and
vanity
of
his
mother
'
s
nature
,
and
in
that
saw
infinite
peril
for
sibyl
and
sibyl
'
s
happiness
.
children
begin
by
loving
their
parents
;
as
they
grow
older
they
judge
them
;
sometimes
they
forgive
them
.
his
mother
!
he
had
something
on
his
mind
to
ask
of
her
,
something
that
he
had
brooded
on
for
many
months
of
silence
.
a
chance
phrase
that
he
had
heard
at
the
theatre
,
a
whispered
sneer
that
had
reached
his
ears
one
night
as
he
waited
at
the
stage
-
door
,
had
set
loose
a
train
of
horrible
thoughts
.
he
remembered
it
as
if
it
had
been
the
lash
of
a
hunting
-
crop
across
his
face
.
his
brows
knit
together
into
a
wedge
-
like
furrow
,
and
with
a
twitch
of
pain
he
bit
his
under
-
lip
.
"
you
are
not
listening
to
a
word
i
am
saying
,
jim
,
"
cried
sibyl
,
"
and
i
am
making
the
most
delightful
plans
for
your
future
.
do
say
something
.
"
"
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
?
"
"
oh
!
that
you
will
be
a
good
boy
,
and
not
forget
us
,
"
she
answered
,
smiling
at
him
.
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
"
you
are
more
likely
to
forget
me
,
than
i
am
to
forget
you
,
sibyl
.
"
she
flushed
.
"
what
do
you
mean
,
jim
?
"
she
asked
.
"
you
have
a
new
friend
,
i
hear
.
who
is
he
?
why
have
you
not
told
me
about
him
?
he
means
you
no
good
.
"
"
stop
,
jim
!
"
she
exclaimed
.
"
you
must
not
say
anything
against
him
.
i
love
him
.
"
"
why
,
you
don
'
t
even
know
his
name
,
"
answered
the
lad
.
"
who
is
he
?
i
have
a
right
to
know
.
"
"
he
is
called
prince
charming
.
don
'
t
you
like
the
name
?
oh
!
you
silly
boy
!
you
should
never
forget
it
.
if
you
only
saw
him
,
you
would
think
him
the
most
wonderful
person
in
the
world
.
some
day
you
will
meet
him
:
when
you
come
back
from
australia
.
you
will
like
him
so
much
.
everybody
likes
him
,
and
i
.
.
.
love
him
.
i
wish
you
could
come
to
the
theatre
to
-
night
.
he
is
going
to
be
there
,
and
i
am
to
play
juliet
.
oh
!
how
i
shall
play
it
!
fancy
,
jim
,
to
be
in
love
and
play
juliet
!
to
have
him
sitting
there
!
to
play
for
his
delight
!
i
am
afraid
i
may
frighten
the
company
,
frighten
or
enthrall
them
.
to
be
in
love
is
to
surpass
one
'
s
self
.
poor
dreadful
mr
.
isaacs
will
be
shouting
'
genius
'
to
his
loafers
at
the
bar
.
he
has
preached
me
as
a
dogma
;
to
-
night
he
will
announce
me
as
a
revelation
.
i
feel
it
.
and
it
is
all
his
,
his
only
,
prince
charming
,
my
wonderful
lover
,
my
god
of
graces
.
but
i
am
poor
beside
him
.
poor
?
what
does
that
matter
?
when
poverty
creeps
in
at
the
door
,
love
flies
in
through
the
window

"
he
is

said
the
lad
,
sullenly
.
"
a
prince

"
she
cried
,
musically
.
"
what
more
do
you
want
?
"
"
he
wants
to
enslave
you
.
"
"
i
shudder
at
the
thought

being
free

"
i
want
you
to
beware
of
him

"
"
to
see
him

to
worship
him

to

"
"
sibyl
,
you
are
mad
about
him

"
she
laughed
,
and
took
his
arm
.
"
you
dear
old
jim
,
you
talk
as
if
you
were

hundred

some
day
you
will
be
in

then
you
will
know

it

don

look
so
sulky

surely
you
should
be
glad
to
think
that
,
though
you
are
going
away
,
you
leave
me
happier
than
i
have
ever

terribly
hard

difficult

different
now
.
you
are
going
to
a
new
world
,
and
i
have
found
one
.
here
are
two
chairs
;
let
us
sit
down
and
see
the
smart
people
go
by
.
"
they
took
their
seats
amidst
a
crowd
of
watchers
.
the
tulip
-
beds
across
the
road
flamed
like
throbbing
rings
of
fire
.
a
white
dust
,
tremulous
cloud
of
orris
-
root
it
seemed
,
hung
in
the
panting
air
.
the
brightly
-
coloured
parasols
danced
and
dipped
like
monstrous
butterflies
.
she
made
her
brother
talk
of
himself
,
his
hopes
,
his
prospects
.
he
spoke
slowly
and
with
effort
.
they
passed
words
to
each
other
as
players
at
a
game
pass
counters
.
sibyl
felt
oppressed
.
she
could
not
communicate
her
joy
.
a
faint
smile
curving
that
sullen
mouth
was
all
the
echo
she
could
win
.
after
some
time
she
became
silent
.
suddenly
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
golden
hair
and
laughing
lips
,
and
in
an
open
carriage
with
two
ladies
dorian
gray
drove
past
.
she
started
to
her
feet
.
"
there
he
is
!
"
she
cried
.
"
who
?
"
said
jim
vane
.
"
prince
charming
,
"
she
answered
,
looking
after
the
victoria
.
he
jumped
up
,
and
seized
her
roughly
by
the
arm
.
"
show
him
to
me
.
which
is
he
?
point
him
out
.
i
must
see
him
!
"
he
exclaimed
;
but
at
that
moment
the
duke
of
berwick
'
s
four
-
in
-
hand
came
between
,
and
when
it
had
left
the
space
clear
,
the
carriage
had
swept
out
of
the
park
.
"
he
is
gone
,
"
murmured
sibyl
,
sadly
.
"
i
wish
you
had
seen
him
.
"
"
i
wish
i
had
,
for
as
sure
as
there
is
a
god
in
heaven
,
if
he
ever
does
you
any
wrong
i
shall
kill
him
.
"
she
looked
at
him
in
horror
.
he
repeated
his
words
.
they
cut
the
air
like
a
dagger
.
the
people
round
began
to
gape
.
a
lady
standing
close
to
her
tittered
.
"
come
away
,
jim
;
come
away
,
"
she
whispered
.
he
followed
her
doggedly
,
as
she
passed
through
the
crowd
.
he
felt
glad
at
what
he
had
said
.
when
they
reached
the
achilles
statue
she
turned
round
.
there
was
pity
in
her
eyes
that
became
laughter
on
her
lips
.
she
shook
her
head
at
him
.
"
you
are
foolish
,
jim
,
utterly
foolish
;
a
bad
-
tempered
boy
,
that
is
all
.
how
can
you
say
such
horrible
things
?
you
don
'
t
know
what
you
are
talking
about
.
you
are
simply
jealous
and
unkind
.
ah
!
i
wish
you
would
fall
in
love
.
love
makes
people
good
,
and
what
you
said
was
wicked
.
"
"
i
am
sixteen
,
"
he
answered
,
"
and
i
know
what
i
am
about
.
mother
is
no
help
to
you
.
she
doesn
'
t
understand
how
to
look
after
you
.
i
wish
now
that
i
was
not
going
to
australia
at
all
.
i
have
a
great
mind
to
chuck
the
whole
thing
up
.
i
would
,
if
my
articles
hadn
'
t
been
signed
.
"
"
oh
,
don
'
t
be
so
serious
,
jim
.
you
are
like
one
of
the
heroes
of
those
silly
melodramas
mother
used
to
be
so
fond
of
acting
in
.
i
am
not
going
to
quarrel
with
you
.
i
have
seen
him
,
and
oh
!
to
see
him
is
perfect
happiness
.
we
won
'
t
quarrel
.
i
know
you
would
never
harm
anyone
i
love
,
would
you
?
"
"
not
as
long
as
you
love
him
,
i
suppose
,
"
was
the
sullen
answer
.
"
i
shall
love
him
for
ever
!
"
she
cried
.
"
and
he
?
"
"
for
ever
,
too
!
"
"
he
had
better
.
"
she
shrank
from
him
.
then
she
laughed
and
put
her
hand
on
his
arm
.
he
was
merely
a
boy
.
at
the
marble
arch
they
hailed
an
omnibus
,
which
left
them
close
to
their
shabby
home
in
the
euston
road
.
it
was
after
five
o
'
clock
,
and
sibyl
had
to
lie
down
for
a
couple
of
hours
before
acting
.
jim
insisted
that
she
should
do
so
.
he
said
that
he
would
sooner
part
with
her
when
their
mother
was
not
present
.
she
would
be
sure
to
make
a
scene
,
and
he
detested
scenes
of
every
kind
.
in
sibyl
'
s
own
room
they
parted
.
there
was
jealousy
in
the
lad
'
s
heart
,
and
a
fierce
,
murderous
hatred
of
the
stranger
who
,
as
it
seemed
to
him
,
had
come
between
them
.
yet
,
when
her
arms
were
flung
round
his
neck
,
and
her
fingers
strayed
through
his
hair
,
he
softened
,
and
kissed
her
with
real
affection
.
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
as
he
went
downstairs
.
his
mother
was
waiting
for
him
below
.
she
grumbled
at
his
unpunctuality
,
as
he
entered
.
he
made
no
answer
,
but
sat
down
to
his
meagre
meal
.
the
flies
buzzed
round
the
table
,
and
crawled
over
the
stained
cloth
.
through
the
rumble
of
omnibuses
,
and
the
clatter
of
street
-
cabs
,
he
could
hear
the
droning
voice
devouring
each
minute
that
was
left
to
him
.
after
some
time
,
he
thrust
away
his
plate
,
and
put
his
head
in
his
hands
.
he
felt
that
he
had
a
right
to
know
.
it
should
have
been
told
to
him
before
,
if
it
was
as
he
suspected
.
leaden
with
fear
,
his
mother
watched
him
.
words
dropped
mechanically
from
her
lips
.
a
tattered
lace
handkerchief
twitched
in
her
fingers
.
when
the
clock
struck
six
,
he
got
up
,
and
went
to
the
door
.
then
he
turned
back
,
and
looked
at
her
.
their
eyes
met
.
in
hers
he
saw
a
wild
appeal
for
mercy
.
it
enraged
him
.
"
mother
,
i
have
something
to
ask
you
,
"
he
said
.
her
eyes
wandered
vaguely
about
the
room
.
she
made
no
answer
.
"
tell
me
the
truth
.
i
have
a
right
to
know
.
were
you
married
to
my
father
?
"
she
heaved
a
deep
sigh
.
it
was
a
sigh
of
relief
.
the
terrible
moment
,
the
moment
that
night
and
day
,
for
weeks
and
months
,
she
had
dreaded
,
had
come
at
last
,
and
yet
she
felt
no
terror
.
indeed
in
some
measure
it
was
a
disappointment
to
her
.
the
vulgar
directness
of
the
question
called
for
a
direct
answer
.
the
situation
had
not
been
gradually
led
up
to
.
it
was
crude
.
it
reminded
her
of
a
bad
rehearsal
.
"
no
,
"
she
answered
,
wondering
at
the
harsh
simplicity
of
life
.
"
my
father
was
a
scoundrel
then
?
"
cried
the
lad
,
clenching
his
fists
.
she
shook
her
head
.
"
i
knew
he
was
not
free
.
we
loved
each
other
very
much
.
if
he
had
lived
,
he
would
have
made
provision
for
us
.
don
'
t
speak
against
him
,
my
son
.
he
was
your
father
,
and
a
gentleman
.
indeed
he
was
highly
connected
.
"
an
oath
broke
from
his
lips
.
"
i
don
'
t
care
for
myself
,
"
he
exclaimed
,
"
but
don
'
t
let
sibyl
.
.
.
.
it
is
a
gentleman
,
isn
'
t
it
,
who
is
in
love
with
her
,
or
says
he
is
?
highly
connected
,
too
,
i
suppose
.
"
for
a
moment
a
hideous
sense
of
humiliation
came
over
the
woman
.
her
head
drooped
.
she
wiped
her
eyes
with
shaking
hands
.
"
sibyl
has
a
mother
,
"
she
murmured
;
"
i
had
none
.
"
the
lad
was
touched
.
he
went
towards
her
,
and
stooping
down
he
kissed
her
.
"
i
am
sorry
if
i
have
pained
you
by
asking
about
my
father
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
i
could
not
help
it
.
i
must
go
now
.
good
-
bye
.
don
'
t
forget
that
you
will
only
have
one
child
now
to
look
after
,
and
believe
me
that
if
this
man
wrongs
my
sister
,
i
will
find
out
who
he
is
,
track
him
down
,
and
kill
him
like
a
dog
.
i
swear
it
.
"
the
exaggerated
folly
of
the
threat
,
the
passionate
gesture
that
accompanied
it
,
the
mad
melodramatic
words
,
made
life
seem
more
vivid
to
her
.
she
was
familiar
with
the
atmosphere
.
she
breathed
more
freely
,
and
for
the
first
time
for
many
months
she
really
admired
her
son
.
she
would
have
liked
to
have
continued
the
scene
on
the
same
emotional
scale
,
but
he
cut
her
short
.
trunks
had
to
be
carried
down
,
and
mufflers
looked
for
.
the
lodging
-
house
drudge
bustled
in
and
out
.
there
was
the
bargaining
with
the
cabman
.
the
moment
was
lost
in
vulgar
details
.
it
was
with
a
renewed
feeling
of
disappointment
that
she
waved
the
tattered
lace
handkerchief
from
the
window
,
as
her
son
drove
away
.
she
was
conscious
that
a
great
opportunity
had
been
wasted
.
she
consoled
herself
by
telling
sibyl
how
desolate
she
felt
her
life
would
be
,
now
that
she
had
only
one
child
to
look
after
.
she
remembered
the
phrase
.
it
had
pleased
her
.
of
the
threat
she
said
nothing
.
it
was
vividly
and
dramatically
expressed
.
she
felt
that
they
would
all
laugh
at
it
some
day
.
chapter
vi
"
i
suppose
you
have
heard
the
news
,
basil
?
"
said
lord
henry
that
evening
,
as
hallward
was
shown
into
a
little
private
room
at
the
bristol
where
dinner
had
been
laid
for
three
.
"
no
,
harry
,
"
answered
the
artist
,
giving
his
hat
and
coat
to
the
bowing
waiter
.
"
what
is
it
?
nothing
about
politics
,
i
hope
?
they
don
'
t
interest
me
.
there
is
hardly
a
single
person
in
the
house
of
commons
worth
painting
;
though
many
of
them
would
be
the
better
for
a
little
white
-
washing
.
"
"
dorian
gray
is
engaged
to
be
married
,
"
said
lord
henry
,
watching
him
as
he
spoke
.
hallward
started
,
and
then
frowned
.
"
dorian
engaged
to
be
married
!
"
he
cried
.
"
impossible
!
"
"
it
is
perfectly
true
.
"
"
to
whom
?
"
"
to
some
little
actress
or
other
.
"
"
i
can
'
t
believe
it
.
dorian
is
far
too
sensible
.
"
"
dorian
is
far
too
wise
not
to
do
foolish
things
now
and
then
,
my
dear
basil
.
"
"
marriage
is
hardly
a
thing
that
one
can
do
now
and
then
,
harry
.
"
"
except
in
america
,
"
rejoined
lord
henry
,
languidly
.
"
but
i
didn
'
t
say
he
was
married
.
i
said
he
was
engaged
to
be
married
.
there
is
a
great
difference
.
i
have
a
distinct
remembrance
of
being
married
,
but
i
have
no
recollection
at
all
of
being
engaged
.
i
am
inclined
to
think
that
i
never
was
engaged
.
"
"
but
think
of
dorian
'
s
birth
,
and
position
,
and
wealth
.
it
would
be
absurd
for
him
to
marry
so
much
beneath
him
.
"
"
if
you
want
to
make
him
marry
this
girl
tell
him
that
,
basil
.
he
is
sure
to
do
it
,
then
.
whenever
a
man
does
a
thoroughly
stupid
thing
,
it
is
always
from
the
noblest
motives
.
"
"
i
hope
the
girl
is
good
,
harry
.
i
don
'
t
want
to
see
dorian
tied
to
some
vile
creature
,
who
might
degrade
his
nature
and
ruin
his
intellect
.
"
"
oh
,
she
is
better
than
good
-
-
she
is
beautiful
,
"
murmured
lord
henry
,
sipping
a
glass
of
vermouth
and
orange
-
bitters
.
"
dorian
says
she
is
beautiful
;
and
he
is
not
often
wrong
about
things
of
that
kind
.
your
portrait
of
him
has
quickened
his
appreciation
of
the
personal
appearance
of
other
people
.
it
has
had
that
excellent
effect
,
amongst
others
.
we
are
to
see
her
to
-
night
,
if
that
boy
doesn
'
t
forget
his
appointment
.
"
"
are
you
serious
?
"
"
quite
serious
,
basil
.
i
should
be
miserable
if
i
thought
i
should
ever
be
more
serious
than
i
am
at
the
present
moment
.
"
"
but
do
you
approve
of
it
,
harry
?
"
asked
the
painter
,
walking
up
and
down
the
room
,
and
biting
his
lip
.
"
you
can
'
t
approve
of
it
,
possibly
.
it
is
some
silly
infatuation
.
"
"
i
never
approve
,
or
disapprove
,
of
anything
now
.
it
is
an
absurd
attitude
to
take
towards
life
.
we
are
not
sent
into
the
world
to
air
our
moral
prejudices
.
i
never
take
any
notice
of
what
common
people
say
,
and
i
never
interfere
with
what
charming
people
do
.
if
a
personality
fascinates
me
,
whatever
mode
of
expression
that
personality
selects
is
absolutely
delightful
to
me
.
dorian
gray
falls
in
love
with
a
beautiful
girl
who
acts
juliet
,
and
proposes
to
marry
her
.
why
not
?
if
he
wedded
messalina
he
would
be
none
the
less
interesting
.
you
know
i
am
not
a
champion
of
marriage
.
the
real
drawback
to
marriage
is
that
it
makes
one
unselfish
.
and
unselfish
people
are
colourless
.
they
lack
individuality
.
still
,
there
are
certain
temperaments
that
marriage
makes
more
complex
.
they
retain
their
egotism
,
and
add
to
it
many
other
egos
.
they
are
forced
to
have
more
than
one
life
.
they
become
more
highly
organised
,
and
to
be
highly
organised
is
,
i
should
fancy
,
the
object
of
man
'
s
existence
.
besides
,
every
experience
is
of
value
,
and
,
whatever
one
may
say
against
marriage
,
it
is
certainly
an
experience
.
i
hope
that
dorian
gray
will
make
this
girl
his
wife
,
passionately
adore
her
for
six
months
,
and
then
suddenly
become
fascinated
by
someone
else
.
he
would
be
a
wonderful
study
.
"
"
you
don
'
t
mean
a
single
word
of
all
that
,
harry
;
you
know
you
don
'
t
.
if
dorian
gray
'
s
life
were
spoiled
,
no
one
would
be
sorrier
than
yourself
.
you
are
much
better
than
you
pretend
to
be
.
"
lord
henry
laughed
.
"
the
reason
we
all
like
to
think
so
well
of
others
is
that
we
are
all
afraid
for
ourselves
.
the
basis
of
optimism
is
sheer
terror
.
we
think
that
we
are
generous
because
we
credit
our
neighbour
with
the
possession
of
those
virtues
that
are
likely
to
be
a
benefit
to
us
.
we
praise
the
banker
that
we
may
overdraw
our
account
,
and
find
good
qualities
in
the
highwayman
in
the
hope
that
he
may
spare
our
pockets
.
i
mean
everything
that
i
have
said
.
i
have
the
greatest
contempt
for
optimism
.
as
for
a
spoiled
life
,
no
life
is
spoiled
but
one
whose
growth
is
arrested
.
if
you
want
to
mar
a
nature
,
you
have
merely
to
reform
it
.
as
for
marriage
,
of
course
that
would
be
silly
,
but
there
are
other
and
more
interesting
bonds
between
men
and
women
.
i
will
certainly
encourage
them
.
they
have
the
charm
of
being
fashionable
.
but
here
is
dorian
himself
.
he
will
tell
you
more
than
i
can
.
"
"
my
dear
harry
,
my
dear
basil
,
you
must
both
congratulate
me
!
"
said
the
lad
,
throwing
off
his
evening
cape
with
its
satin
-
lined
wings
and
shaking
each
of
his
friends
by
the
hand
in
turn
.
"
i
have
never
been
so
happy
.
of
course
it
is
sudden
;
all
really
delightful
things
are
.
and
yet
it
seems
to
me
to
be
the
one
thing
i
have
been
looking
for
all
my
life
.
"
he
was
flushed
with
excitement
and
pleasure
,
and
looked
extraordinarily
handsome
.
"
i
hope
you
will
always
be
very
happy
,
dorian
,
"
said
hallward
,
"
but
i
don
'
t
quite
forgive
you
for
not
having
let
me
know
of
your
engagement
.
you
let
harry
know
.
"
"
and
i
don
'
t
forgive
you
for
being
late
for
dinner
,
"
broke
in
lord
henry
,
putting
his
hand
on
the
lad
'
s
shoulder
,
and
smiling
as
he
spoke
.
"
come
,
let
us
sit
down
and
try
what
the
new
_
chef
_
here
is
like
,
and
then
you
will
tell
us
how
it
all
came
about
.
"
"
there
is
really
not
much
to
tell
,
"
cried
dorian
,
as
they
took
their
seats
at
the
small
round
table
.
"
what
happened
was
simply
this
.
after
i
left
you
yesterday
evening
,
harry
,
i
dressed
,
had
some
dinner
at
that
little
italian
restaurant
in
rupert
street
you
introduced
me
to
,
and
went
down
at
eight
o
'
clock
to
the
theatre
.
sibyl
was
playing
rosalind
.
of
course
the
scenery
was
dreadful
,
and
the
orlando
absurd
.
but
sibyl
!
you
should
have
seen
her
!
when
she
came
on
in
her
boy
'
s
clothes
she
was
perfectly
wonderful
.
she
wore
a
moss
-
coloured
velvet
jerkin
with
cinnamon
sleeves
,
slim
brown
cross
-
gartered
hose
,
a
dainty
little
green
cap
with
a
hawk
'
s
feather
caught
in
a
jewel
,
and
a
hooded
cloak
lined
with
dull
red
.
she
had
never
seemed
to
me
more
exquisite
.
she
had
all
the
delicate
grace
of
that
tanagra
figurine
that
you
have
in
your
studio
,
basil
.
her
hair
clustered
round
her
face
like
dark
leaves
round
a
pale
rose
.
as
for
her
acting
-
-
well
,
you
shall
see
her
to
-
night
.
she
is
simply
a
born
artist
.
i
sat
in
the
dingy
box
absolutely
enthralled
.
i
forgot
that
i
was
in
london
and
in
the
nineteenth
century
.
i
was
away
with
my
love
in
a
forest
that
no
man
had
ever
seen
.
after
the
performance
was
over
i
went
behind
,
and
spoke
to
her
.
as
we
were
sitting
together
,
suddenly
there
came
into
her
eyes
a
look
that
i
had
never
seen
there
before
.
my
lips
moved
towards
hers
.
we
kissed
each
other
.
i
can
'
t
describe
to
you
what
i
felt
at
that
moment
.
it
seemed
to
me
that
all
my
life
had
been
narrowed
to
one
perfect
point
of
rose
-
coloured
joy
.
she
trembled
all
over
,
and
shook
like
a
white
narcissus
.
then
she
flung
herself
on
her
knees
and
kissed
my
hands
.
i
feel
that
i
should
not
tell
you
all
this
,
but
i
can
'
t
help
it
.
of
course
our
engagement
is
a
dead
secret
.
she
has
not
even
told
her
own
mother
.
i
don
'
t
know
what
my
guardians
will
say
.
lord
radley
is
sure
to
be
furious
.
i
don
'
t
care
.
i
shall
be
of
age
in
less
than
a
year
,
and
then
i
can
do
what
i
like
.
i
have
been
right
,
basil
,
haven
'
t
i
,
to
take
my
love
out
of
poetry
,
and
to
find
my
wife
in
shakespeare
'
s
plays
?
lips
that
shakespeare
taught
to
speak
have
whispered
their
secret
in
my
ear
.
i
have
had
the
arms
of
rosalind
around
me
,
and
kissed
juliet
on
the
mouth
.
"
"
yes
,
dorian
,
i
suppose
you
were
right
,
"
said
hallward
,
slowly
.
"
have
you
seen
her
to
-
day
?
"
asked
lord
henry
.
dorian
gray
shook
his
head
.
"
i
left
her
in
the
forest
of
arden
,
i
shall
find
her
in
an
orchard
in
verona
.
"
lord
henry
sipped
his
champagne
in
a
meditative
manner
.
"
at
what
particular
point
did
you
mention
the
word
marriage
,
dorian
?
and
what
did
she
say
in
answer
?
perhaps
you
forgot
all
about
it
.
"
"
my
dear
harry
,
i
did
not
treat
it
as
a
business
transaction
,
and
i
did
not
make
any
formal
proposal
.
i
told
her
that
i
loved
her
,
and
she
said
she
was
not
worthy
to
be
my
wife
.
not
worthy
!
why
,
the
whole
world
is
nothing
to
me
compared
with
her
.
"
"
women
are
wonderfully
practical
,
"
murmured
lord
henry
-
-
"
much
more
practical
than
we
are
.
in
situations
of
that
kind
we
often
forget
to
say
anything
about
marriage
,
and
they
always
remind
us
.
"
hallward
laid
his
hand
upon
his
arm
.
"
don
'
t
,
harry
.
you
have
annoyed
dorian
.
he
is
not
like
other
men
.
he
would
never
bring
misery
upon
anyone
.
his
nature
is
too
fine
for
that
.
"
lord
henry
looked
across
the
table
.
"
dorian
is
never
annoyed
with
me
,
"
he
answered
.
"
i
asked
the
question
for
the
best
reason
possible
,
for
the
only
reason
,
indeed
,
that
excuses
one
for
asking
any
question
-
-
simple
curiosity
.
i
have
a
theory
that
it
is
always
the
women
who
propose
to
us
,
and
not
we
who
propose
to
the
women
.
except
,
of
course
,
in
middle
-
class
life
.
but
then
the
middle
classes
are
not
modern
.
"
dorian
gray
laughed
,
and
tossed
his
head
.
"
you
are
quite
incorrigible
,
harry
;
but
i
don
'
t
mind
.
it
is
impossible
to
be
angry
with
you
.
when
you
see
sibyl
vane
you
will
feel
that
the
man
who
could
wrong
her
would
be
a
beast
,
a
beast
without
a
heart
.
i
cannot
understand
how
anyone
can
wish
to
shame
the
thing
he
loves
.
i
love
sibyl
vane
.
i
want
to
place
her
on
a
pedestal
of
gold
,
and
to
see
the
world
worship
the
woman
who
is
mine
.
what
is
marriage
?
an
irrevocable
vow
.
you
mock
at
it
for
that
.
ah
!
don
'
t
mock
.
it
is
an
irrevocable
vow
that
i
want
to
take
.
her
trust
makes
me
faithful
,
her
belief
makes
me
good
.
when
i
am
with
her
,
i
regret
all
that
you
have
taught
me
.
i
become
different
from
what
you
have
known
me
to
be
.
i
am
changed
,
and
the
mere
touch
of
sibyl
vane
'
s
hand
makes
me
forget
you
and
all
your
wrong
,
fascinating
,
poisonous
,
delightful
theories
.
"
"
and
those
are
.
.
.
?
"
asked
lord
henry
,
helping
himself
to
some
salad
.
"
oh
,
your
theories
about
life
,
your
theories
about
love
,
your
theories
about
pleasure
.
all
your
theories
,
in
fact
,
harry
.
"
"
pleasure
is
the
only
thing
worth
having
a
theory
about
,
"
he
answered
,
in
his
slow
,
melodious
voice
.
"
but
i
am
afraid
i
cannot
claim
my
theory
as
my
own
.
it
belongs
to
nature
,
not
to
me
.
pleasure
is
nature
'
s
test
,
her
sign
of
approval
.
when
we
are
happy
we
are
always
good
,
but
when
we
are
good
we
are
not
always
happy
.
"
"
ah
!
but
what
do
you
mean
by
good
?
"
cried
basil
hallward
.
"
yes
,
"
echoed
dorian
,
leaning
back
in
his
chair
,
and
looking
at
lord
henry
over
the
heavy
clusters
of
purple
-
lipped
irises
that
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
table
,
"
what
do
you
mean
by
good
,
harry
?
"
"
to
be
good
is
to
be
in
harmony
with
one
'
s
self
,
"
he
replied
,
touching
the
thin
stem
of
his
glass
with
his
pale
,
fine
-
pointed
fingers
.
"
discord
is
to
be
forced
to
be
in
harmony
with
others
.
one
'
s
own
life
-
-
that
is
the
important
thing
.
as
for
the
lives
of
one
'
s
neighbours
,
if
one
wishes
to
be
a
prig
or
a
puritan
,
one
can
flaunt
one
'
s
moral
views
about
them
,
but
they
are
not
one
'
s
concern
.
besides
,
individualism
has
really
the
higher
aim
.
modern
morality
consists
in
accepting
the
standard
of
one
'
s
age
.
i
consider
that
for
any
man
of
culture
to
accept
the
standard
of
his
age
is
a
form
of
the
grossest
immorality
.
"
"
but
,
surely
,
if
one
lives
merely
for
one
'
s
self
,
harry
,
one
pays
a
terrible
price
for
doing
so
?
"
suggested
the
painter
.
"
yes
,
we
are
overcharged
for
everything
nowadays
.
i
should
fancy
that
the
real
tragedy
of
the
poor
is
that
they
can
afford
nothing
but
self
-
denial
.
beautiful
sins
,
like
beautiful
things
,
are
the
privilege
of
the
rich
.
"
"
one
has
to
pay
in
other
ways
but
money
.
"
"
what
sort
of
ways
,
basil
?
"
"
oh
!
i
should
fancy
in
remorse
,
in
suffering
,
in
.
.
.
well
,
in
the
consciousness
of
degradation
.
"
lord
henry
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
"
my
dear
fellow
,
medi
val
art
is
charming
,
but
medi
val
emotions
are
out
of
date
.
one
can
use
them
in
fiction
,
of
course
.
but
then
the
only
things
that
one
can
use
in
fiction
are
the
things
that
one
has
ceased
to
use
in
fact
.
believe
me
,
no
civilised
man
ever
regrets
a
pleasure
,
and
no
uncivilised
man
ever
knows
what
a
pleasure
is
.
"
"
i
know
what
pleasure
is
,
"
cried
dorian
gray
.
"
it
is
to
adore
someone
.
"
"
that
is
certainly
better
than
being
adored
,
"
he
answered
,
toying
with
some
fruits
.
"
being
adored
is
a
nuisance
.
women
treat
us
just
as
humanity
treats
its
gods
.
they
worship
us
,
and
are
always
bothering
us
to
do
something
for
them
.
"
"
i
should
have
said
that
whatever
they
ask
for
they
had
first
given
to
us
,
"
murmured
the
lad
,
gravely
.
"
they
create
love
in
our
natures
.
they
have
a
right
to
demand
it
back
.
"
"
that
is
quite
true
,
dorian
,
"
cried
hallward
.
"
nothing
is
ever
quite
true
,
"
said
lord
henry
.
"
this
is
,
"
interrupted
dorian
.
"
you
must
admit
,
harry
,
that
women
give
to
men
the
very
gold
of
their
lives
.
"
"
possibly
,
"
he
sighed
,
"
but
they
invariably
want
it
back
in
such
very
small
change
.
that
is
the
worry
.
women
,
as
some
witty
frenchman
once
put
it
,
inspire
us
with
the
desire
to
do
masterpieces
,
and
always
prevent
us
from
carrying
them
out
.
"
"
harry
,
you
are
dreadful
!
i
don

know
why
i
like
you
so
much

"
"
you
will
always
like

he
replied

will
you

is
the
perfect

it
leaves
one
unsatisfied

what
more
can
one
want

yes

dorian

you
will
always
be
fond

i

commit

"
what
nonsense
you
talk
,
harry

cried
the
lad
,
taking
a
light
from
a
fire
-
breathing
silver
dragon
that
the
waiter
had
placed
on
the
table

"
let
us
go
down
to
the
theatre

when

"

"
said
lord

with
a
tired
look
in

eyes
,
"

i
am
always
ready

a
new
emotion

am
afraid

there
is
no

still

your

go

so
sorry

there
is
only
room
for
two
in

brougham

you
must
follow
us
in

hansom

"
they
got
up
and
put
on
their
coats
,
sipping
their
coffee
standing
.
the
painter
was
silent
and
preoccupied
.
there
was
a
gloom
over
him
.
he
could
not
bear
this
marriage
,
and
yet
it
seemed
to
him
to
be
better
than
many
other
things
that
might
have
happened
.
after
a
few
minutes
,
they
all
passed
downstairs
.
he
drove
off
by
himself
,
as
had
been
arranged
,
and
watched
the
flashing
lights
of
the
little
brougham
in
front
of
him
.
a
strange
sense
of
loss
came
over
him
.
he
felt
that
dorian
gray
would
never
again
be
to
him
all
that
he
had
been
in
the
past
.
life
had
come
between
them
.
.
.
.
his
eyes
darkened
,
and
the
crowded
,
flaring
streets
became
blurred
to
his
eyes
.
when
the
cab
drew
up
at
the
theatre
,
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
grown
years
older
.
chapter
vii
for
some
reason
or
other
,
the
house
was
crowded
that
night
,
and
the
fat
jew
manager
who
met
them
at
the
door
was
beaming
from
ear
to
ear
with
an
oily
,
tremulous
smile
.
he
escorted
them
to
their
box
with
a
sort
of
pompous
humility
,
waving
his
fat
jewelled
hands
,
and
talking
at
the
top
of
his
voice
.
dorian
gray
loathed
him
more
than
ever

he
felt
as
if
he
had
come
to
look
for
miranda
and
had
been
met
by

upon

other
hand
,
rather
liked
him
.
at
least
he
declared
he
did
,
and
insisted
on
shaking
him
by
the
hand
,
and
assuring
him
that
he
was
proud
to
meet
a
man
who
had
discovered
a
real
genius
and
gone
bankrupt
over
a
poet
.
hallward
amused
himself
with
watching
the
faces
in
the
pit
.
the
heat
was
terribly
oppressive
,
and
the
huge
sunlight
flamed
like
a
monstrous
dahlia
with
petals
of
yellow
fire
.
the
youths
in
the
gallery
had
taken
off
their
coats
and
waistcoats
and
hung
them
over
the
side
.
they
talked
to
each
other
across
the
theatre
,
and
shared
their
oranges
with
the
tawdry
girls
who
sat
beside
them
.
some
women
were
laughing
in
the
pit
.
their
voices
were
horribly
shrill
and
discordant
.
the
sound
of
the
popping
of
corks
came
from
the
bar
.
"
what
a
place
to
find
one
'
s
divinity
in
!
"
said
lord
henry
.
"
yes
!
"
answered
dorian
gray
.
"
it
was
here
i
found
her
,
and
she
is
divine
beyond
all
living
things
.
when
she
acts
you
will
forget
everything
.
these
common
,
rough
people
,
with
their
coarse
faces
and
brutal
gestures
,
become
quite
different
when
she
is
on
the
stage
.
they
sit
silently
and
watch
her
.
they
weep
and
laugh
as
she
wills
them
to
do
.
she
makes
them
as
responsive
as
a
violin
.
she
spiritualises
them
,
and
one
feels
that
they
are
of
the
same
flesh
and
blood
as
one
'
s
self
.
"
"
the
same
flesh
and
blood
as
one
'
s
self
!
oh
,
i
hope
not
!
"
exclaimed
lord
henry
,
who
was
scanning
the
occupants
of
the
gallery
through
his
opera
-
glass
.
"
don
'
t
pay
any
attention
to
him
,
dorian
,
"
said
the
painter
.
"
i
understand
what
you
mean
,
and
i
believe
in
this
girl
.
anyone
you
love
must
be
marvellous
,
and
any
girl
that
has
the
effect
you
describe
must
be
fine
and
noble
.
to
spiritualise
one
'
s
age
-
-
that
is
something
worth
doing
.
if
this
girl
can
give
a
soul
to
those
who
have
lived
without
one
,
if
she
can
create
the
sense
of
beauty
in
people
whose
lives
have
been
sordid
and
ugly
,
if
she
can
strip
them
of
their
selfishness
and
lend
them
tears
for
sorrows
that
are
not
their
own
,
she
is
worthy
of
all
your
adoration
,
worthy
of
the
adoration
of
the
world
.
this
marriage
is
quite
right
.
i
did
not
think
so
at
first
,
but
i
admit
it
now
.
the
gods
made
sibyl
vane
for
you
.
without
her
you
would
have
been
incomplete
.
"
"
thanks
,
basil
,
"
answered
dorian
gray
,
pressing
his
hand
.
"
i
knew
that
you
would
understand
me
.
harry
is
so
cynical
,
he
terrifies
me
.
but
here
is
the
orchestra
.
it
is
quite
dreadful
,
but
it
only
lasts
for
about
five
minutes
.
then
the
curtain
rises
,
and
you
will
see
the
girl
to
whom
i
am
going
to
give
all
my
life
,
to
whom
i
have
given
everything
that
is
good
in
me
.
"
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
,
amidst
an
extraordinary
turmoil
of
applause
,
sibyl
vane
stepped
on
to
the
stage
.
yes
,
she
was
certainly
lovely
to
look
at
-
-
one
of
the
loveliest
creatures
,
lord
henry
thought
,
that
he
had
ever
seen
.
there
was
something
of
the
fawn
in
her
shy
grace
and
startled
eyes
.
a
faint
blush
,
like
the
shadow
of
a
rose
in
a
mirror
of
silver
,
came
to
her
cheeks
as
she
glanced
at
the
crowded
,
enthusiastic
house
.
she
stepped
back
a
few
paces
,
and
her
lips
seemed
to
tremble
.
basil
hallward
leaped
to
his
feet
and
began
to
applaud
.
motionless
,
and
as
one
in
a
dream
,
sat
dorian
gray
,
gazing
at
her
.
lord
henry
peered
through
his
glasses
,
murmuring
,
"
charming
!
charming
!
"
the
scene
was
the
hall
of
capulet
'
s
house
,
and
romeo
in
his
pilgrim
'
s
dress
had
entered
with
mercutio
and
his
other
friends
.
the
band
,
such
as
it
was
,
struck
up
a
few
bars
of
music
,
and
the
dance
began
.
through
the
crowd
of
ungainly
,
shabbily
-
dressed
actors
,
sibyl
vane
moved
like
a
creature
from
a
finer
world
.
her
body
swayed
,
while
she
danced
,
as
a
plant
sways
in
the
water
.
the
curves
of
her
throat
were
the
curves
of
a
white
lily
.
her
hands
seemed
to
be
made
of
cool
ivory
.
yet
she
was
curiously
listless
.
she
showed
no
sign
of
joy
when
her
eyes
rested
on
romeo
.
the
few
words
she
had
to
speak
-
-
good
pilgrim
,
you
do
wrong
your
hand
too
much
,
which
mannerly
devotion
shows
in
this
;
for
saints
have
hands
that
pilgrims
'
hands
do
touch
,
and
palm
to
palm
is
holy
palmers
'
kiss
-
-
with
the
brief
dialogue
that
follows
,
were
spoken
in
a
thoroughly
artificial
manner
.
the
voice
was
exquisite
,
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
tone
it
was
absolutely
false
.
it
was
wrong
in
colour
.
it
took
away
all
the
life
from
the
verse
.
it
made
the
passion
unreal
.
dorian
gray
grew
pale
as
he
watched
her
.
he
was
puzzled
and
anxious
.
neither
of
his
friends
dared
to
say
anything
to
him
.
she
seemed
to
them
to
be
absolutely
incompetent
.
they
were
horribly
disappointed
.
yet
they
felt
that
the
true
test
of
any
juliet
is
the
balcony
scene
of
the
second
act
.
they
waited
for
that
.
if
she
failed
there
,
there
was
nothing
in
her
.
she
looked
charming
as
she
came
out
in
the
moonlight
.
that
could
not
be
denied
.
but
the
staginess
of
her
acting
was
unbearable
,
and
grew
worse
as
she
went
on
.
her
gestures
became
absurdly
artificial
.
she
over
-
emphasised
everything
that
she
had
to
say
.
the
beautiful
passage
-
-
thou
knowest
the
mask
of
night
is
on
my
face
,
else
would
a
maiden
blush
bepaint
my
cheek
for
that
which
thou
hast
heard
me
speak
to
-
night
-
-
was
declaimed
with
the
painful
precision
of
a
schoolgirl
who
has
been
taught
to
recite
by
some
second
-
rate
professor
of
elocution
.
when
she
leaned
over
the
balcony
and
came
to
those
wonderful
lines
-
-
although
i
joy
in
thee
,
i
have
no
joy
of
this
contract
to
-
night
:
it
is
too
rash
,
too
unadvised
,
too
sudden
;
too
like
the
lightning
,
which
doth
cease
to
be
ere
one
can
say
,
"
it
lightens
.
"
sweet
,
good
-
night
!
this
bud
of
love
by
summer
'
s
ripening
breath
may
prove
a
beauteous
flower
when
next
we
meet
-
-
she
spoke
the
words
as
though
they
conveyed
no
meaning
to
her
.
it
was
not
nervousness
.
indeed
,
so
far
from
being
nervous
,
she
was
absolutely
self
-
contained
.
it
was
simply
bad
art
.
she
was
a
complete
failure
.
even
the
common
,
uneducated
audience
of
the
pit
and
gallery
lost
their
interest
in
the
play
.
they
got
restless
,
and
began
to
talk
loudly
and
to
whistle
.
the
jew
manager
,
who
was
standing
at
the
back
of
the
dress
-
circle
,
stamped
and
swore
with
rage
.
the
only
person
unmoved
was
the
girl
herself
.
when
the
second
act
was
over
there
came
a
storm
of
hisses
,
and
lord
henry
got
up
from
his
chair
and
put
on
his
coat
.
"
she
is
quite
beautiful
,
dorian
,
"
he
said
,
"
but
she
can
'
t
act
.
let
us
go
.
"
"
i
am
going
to
see
the
play
through
,
"
answered
the
lad
,
in
a
hard
,
bitter
voice
.
"
i
am
awfully
sorry
that
i
have
made
you
waste
an
evening
,
harry
.
i
apologise
to
you
both
.
"
"
my
dear
dorian
,
i
should
think
miss
vane
was
ill
,
"
interrupted
hallward
.
"
we
will
come
some
other
night
.
"
"
i
wish
she
were
ill
,
"
he
rejoined
.
"
but
she
seems
to
me
to
be
simply
callous
and
cold
.
she
has
entirely
altered
.
last
night
she
was
a
great
artist
.
this
evening
she
is
merely
a
commonplace
,
mediocre
actress
.
"
"
don
'
t
talk
like
that
about
anyone
you
love
,
dorian
.
love
is
a
more
wonderful
thing
than
art
.
"
"
they
are
both
simply
forms
of
imitation
,
"
remarked
lord
henry
.
"
but
do
let
us
go
.
dorian
,
you
must
not
stay
here
any
longer
.
it
is
not
good
for
one
'
s
morals
to
see
bad
acting
.
besides
,
i
don
'
t
suppose
you
will
want
your
wife
to
act
.
so
what
does
it
matter
if
she
plays
juliet
like
a
wooden
doll
?
she
is
very
lovely
,
and
if
she
knows
as
little
about
life
as
she
does
about
acting
,
she
will
be
a
delightful
experience
.
there
are
only
two
kinds
of
people
who
are
really
fascinating
-
-
people
who
know
absolutely
everything
,
and
people
who
know
absolutely
nothing
.
good
heavens
,
my
dear
boy
,
don
'
t
look
so
tragic
!
the
secret
of
remaining
young
is
never
to
have
an
emotion
that
is
unbecoming
.
come
to
the
club
with
basil
and
myself
.
we
will
smoke
cigarettes
and
drink
to
the
beauty
of
sibyl
vane
.
she
is
beautiful
.
what
more
can
you
want
?
"
"
go
away
,
harry
,
"
cried
the
lad
.
"
i
want
to
be
alone
.
basil
,
you
must
go
.
ah
!
can
'
t
you
see
that
my
heart
is
breaking
?
"
the
hot
tears
came
to
his
eyes
.
his
lips
trembled
,
and
,
rushing
to
the
back
of
the
box
,
he
leaned
up
against
the
wall
,
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
.
"
let
us
go
,
basil
,
"
said
lord
henry
,
with
a
strange
tenderness
in
his
voice
;
and
the
two
young
men
passed
out
together
.
a
few
moments
afterwards
the
footlights
flared
up
,
and
the
curtain
rose
on
the
third
act
.
dorian
gray
went
back
to
his
seat
.
he
looked
pale
,
and
proud
,
and
indifferent
.
the
play
dragged
on
,
and
seemed
interminable
.
half
of
the
audience
went
out
,
tramping
in
heavy
boots
,
and
laughing
.
the
whole
thing
was
a
_
fiasco
_
.
the
last
act
was
played
to
almost
empty
benches
.
the
curtain
went
down
on
a
titter
,
and
some
groans
.
as
soon
as
it
was
over
,
dorian
gray
rushed
behind
the
scenes
into
the
greenroom
.
the
girl
was
standing
there
alone
,
with
a
look
of
triumph
on
her
face
.
her
eyes
were
lit
with
an
exquisite
fire
.
there
was
a
radiance
about
her
.
her
parted
lips
were
smiling
over
some
secret
of
their
own
.
when
he
entered
,
she
looked
at
him
,
and
an
expression
of
infinite
