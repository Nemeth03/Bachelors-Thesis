"Wait... did you see that?" she asked. "It’s a once-in-a-lifetime event—absolutely unbelievable!"
(I mean, really... who would have thought?) Scientists say: "This phenomenon happens every 100 years."
Amazing, isn’t it? Numbers, like 42 or 99, appear everywhere.
Look at these symbols: [brackets], {braces}, and (parentheses)—all in one place!
Also, file paths use slashes, like "C:/Users/John_Doe/".
Oh, and don’t forget hyphens, en dashes (5–10 years, 15–20 years), and em dashes—just like this!
Just testing multiple uses of these brackets [], braces {} and parentheses ().
Also some more under_score; ofcourse I forget semicolon;.
