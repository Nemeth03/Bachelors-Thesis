and

chapter
i
treats
of
the
place
where
oliver
twist
was
born
and
of
the
circumstances
attending
his
birth
among
other
public
buildings
in
a
certain
town
which
for
many
reasons
it
will
be
prudent
to
refrain
from
mentioning
and
to
which
i
will
assign
no
fictitious
name
there
is
one
anciently
common
to
most
towns
great
or
small
to
wit
a
workhouse
and
in
this
workhouse
was
born
on
a
day
and
date
which
i
need
not
trouble
myself
to
repeat
inasmuch
as
it
can
be
of
no
possible
consequence
to
the
reader
in
this
stage
of
the
business
at
all
events
the
item
of
mortality
whose
name
is
prefixed
to
the
head
of
this
chapter
for
a
long
time
after
it
was
ushered
into
this
world
of
sorrow
and
trouble
by
the
parish
surgeon
it
remained
a
matter
of
considerable
doubt
whether
the
child
would
survive
to
bear
any
name
at
all
in
which
case
it
is
somewhat
more
than
probable
that
these
memoirs
would
never
have
appeared
or
if
they
had
that
being
comprised
within
a
couple
of
pages
they
would
have
possessed
the
inestimable
merit
of
being
the
most
concise
and
faithful
specimen
of
biography
extant
in
the
literature
of
any
age
or
country
although
i
am
not
disposed
to
maintain
that
being
born
in
a
workhouse
is
in
itself
the
most
fortunate
and
enviable
circumstance
that
can
possibly
befall
a
human
being
i
do
mean
to
say
that
in
this
particular
instance
it
was
the
best
thing
for
oliver
twist
that
could
by
possibility
have
occurred
the
fact
is
that
there
was
considerable
difficulty
in
inducing
oliver
to
take
upon
himself
the
office
of
respiration
a
troublesome
practice
but
one
which
custom
has
rendered
necessary
to
our
easy
existence
and
for
some
time
he
lay
gasping
on
a
little
flock
mattress
rather
unequally
poised
between
this
world
and
the
next
the
balance
being
decidedly
in
favour
of
the
latter
now
if
during
this
brief
period
oliver
had
been
surrounded
by
careful
grandmothers
anxious
aunts
experienced
nurses
and
doctors
of
profound
wisdom
he
would
most
inevitably
and
indubitably
have
been
killed
in
no
time
there
being
nobody
by
however
but
a
pauper
old
woman
who
was
rendered
rather
misty
by
an
unwonted
allowance
of
beer
and
a
parish
surgeon
who
did
such
matters
by
contract
oliver
and
nature
fought
out
the
point
between
them
the
result
was
that
after
a
few
struggles
oliver
breathed
sneezed
and
proceeded
to
advertise
to
the
inmates
of
the
workhouse
the
fact
of
a
new
burden
having
been
imposed
upon
the
parish
by
setting
up
as
loud
a
cry
as
could
reasonably
have
been
expected
from
a
male
infant
who
had
not
been
possessed
of
that
very
useful
appendage
a
voice
for
a
much
longer
space
of
time
than
three
minutes
and
a
quarter
as
oliver
gave
this
first
proof
of
the
free
and
proper
action
of
his
lungs
the
patchwork
coverlet
which
was
carelessly
flung
over
the
iron
bedstead
rustled
the
pale
face
of
a
young
woman
was
raised
feebly
from
the
pillow
and
a
faint
voice
imperfectly
articulated
the
words
let
me
see
the
child
and
die
the
surgeon
had
been
sitting
with
his
face
turned
towards
the
fire
giving
the
palms
of
his
hands
a
warm
and
a
rub
alternately
as
the
young
woman
spoke
he
rose
and
advancing
to
the
bed
s
head
said
with
more
kindness
than
might
have
been
expected
of
him
oh
you
must
not
talk
about
dying
yet
lor
bless
her
dear
heart
no
interposed
the
nurse
hastily
depositing
in
her
pocket
a
green
glass
bottle
the
contents
of
which
she
had
been
tasting
in
a
corner
with
evident
satisfaction
lor
bless
her
dear
heart
when
she
has
lived
as
long
as
i
have
sir
and
had
thirteen
children
of
her
own
and
all
on
em
dead
except
two
and
them
in
the
wurkus
with
me
she
ll
know
better
than
to
take
on
in
that
way
bless
her
dear
heart
think
what
it
is
to
be
a
mother
there
s
a
dear
young
lamb
do
apparently
this
consolatory
perspective
of
a
mother
s
prospects
failed
in
producing
its
due
effect
the
patient
shook
her
head
and
stretched
out
her
hand
towards
the
child
the
surgeon
deposited
it
in
her
arms
she
imprinted
her
cold
white
lips
passionately
on
its
forehead
passed
her
hands
over
her
face
gazed
wildly
round
shuddered
fell
back
and
died
they
chafed
her
breast
hands
and
temples
but
the
blood
had
stopped
forever
they
talked
of
hope
and
comfort
they
had
been
strangers
too
long
it
s
all
over
mrs
thingummy
said
the
surgeon
at
last
ah
poor
dear
so
it
is
said
the
nurse
picking
up
the
cork
of
the
green
bottle
which
had
fallen
out
on
the
pillow
as
she
stooped
to
take
up
the
child
poor
dear
you
needn
t
mind
sending
up
to
me
if
the
child
cries
nurse
said
the
surgeon
putting
on
his
gloves
with
great
deliberation
it
s
very
likely
it
will
be
troublesome
give
it
a
little
gruel
if
it
is
he
put
on
his
hat
and
pausing
by
the
bed
side
on
his
way
to
the
door
added
she
was
a
good
looking
girl
too
where
did
she
come
from
she
was
brought
here
last
night
replied
the
old
woman
by
the
overseer
s
order
she
was
found
lying
in
the
street
she
had
walked
some
distance
for
her
shoes
were
worn
to
pieces
but
where
she
came
from
or
where
she
was
going
to
nobody
knows
the
surgeon
leaned
over
the
body
and
raised
the
left
hand
the
old
story
he
said
shaking
his
head
no
wedding
ring
i
see
ah
good
night
the
medical
gentleman
walked
away
to
dinner
and
the
nurse
having
once
more
applied
herself
to
the
green
bottle
sat
down
on
a
low
chair
before
the
fire
and
proceeded
to
dress
the
infant
what
an
excellent
example
of
the
power
of
dress
young
oliver
twist
was
wrapped
in
the
blanket
which
had
hitherto
formed
his
only
covering
he
might
have
been
the
child
of
a
nobleman
or
a
beggar
it
would
have
been
hard
for
the
haughtiest
stranger
to
have
assigned
him
his
proper
station
in
society
but
now
that
he
was
enveloped
in
the
old
calico
robes
which
had
grown
yellow
in
the
same
service
he
was
badged
and
ticketed
and
fell
into
his
place
at
once
a
parish
child
the
orphan
of
a
workhouse
the
humble
half
starved
drudge
to
be
cuffed
and
buffeted
through
the
world
despised
by
all
and
pitied
by
none
oliver
cried
lustily
if
he
could
have
known
that
he
was
an
orphan
left
to
the
tender
mercies
of
church
wardens
and
overseers
perhaps
he
would
have
cried
the
louder
chapter
ii
treats
of
oliver
twist
s
growth
education
and
board
for
the
next
eight
or
ten
months
oliver
was
the
victim
of
a
systematic
course
of
treachery
and
deception
he
was
brought
up
by
hand
the
hungry
and
destitute
situation
of
the
infant
orphan
was
duly
reported
by
the
workhouse
authorities
to
the
parish
authorities
the
parish
authorities
inquired
with
dignity
of
the
workhouse
authorities
whether
there
was
no
female
then
domiciled
in
the
house
who
was
in
a
situation
to
impart
to
oliver
twist
the
consolation
and
nourishment
of
which
he
stood
in
need
the
workhouse
authorities
replied
with
humility
that
there
was
not
upon
this
the
parish
authorities
magnanimously
and
humanely
resolved
that
oliver
should
be
farmed
or
in
other
words
that
he
should
be
dispatched
to
a
branch
workhouse
some
three
miles
off
where
twenty
or
thirty
other
juvenile
offenders
against
the
poor
laws
rolled
about
the
floor
all
day
without
the
inconvenience
of
too
much
food
or
too
much
clothing
under
the
parental
superintendence
of
an
elderly
female
who
received
the
culprits
at
and
for
the
consideration
of
sevenpence
halfpenny
per
small
head
per
week
sevenpence
halfpenny
s
worth
per
week
is
a
good
round
diet
for
a
child
a
great
deal
may
be
got
for
sevenpence
halfpenny
quite
enough
to
overload
its
stomach
and
make
it
uncomfortable
the
elderly
female
was
a
woman
of
wisdom
and
experience
she
knew
what
was
good
for
children
and
she
had
a
very
accurate
perception
of
what
was
good
for
herself
so
she
appropriated
the
greater
part
of
the
weekly
stipend
to
her
own
use
and
consigned
the
rising
parochial
generation
to
even
a
shorter
allowance
than
was
originally
provided
for
them
thereby
finding
in
the
lowest
depth
a
deeper
still
and
proving
herself
a
very
great
experimental
philosopher
everybody
knows
the
story
of
another
experimental
philosopher
who
had
a
great
theory
about
a
horse
being
able
to
live
without
eating
and
who
demonstrated
it
so
well
that
he
had
got
his
own
horse
down
to
a
straw
a
day
and
would
unquestionably
have
rendered
him
a
very
spirited
and
rampacious
animal
on
nothing
at
all
if
he
had
not
died
four
and
twenty
hours
before
he
was
to
have
had
his
first
comfortable
bait
of
air
unfortunately
for
the
experimental
philosophy
of
the
female
to
whose
protecting
care
oliver
twist
was
delivered
over
a
similar
result
usually
attended
the
operation
of
her
system
for
at
the
very
moment
when
the
child
had
contrived
to
exist
upon
the
smallest
possible
portion
of
the
weakest
possible
food
it
did
perversely
happen
in
eight
and
a
half
cases
out
of
ten
either
that
it
sickened
from
want
and
cold
or
fell
into
the
fire
from
neglect
or
got
half
smothered
by
accident
in
any
one
of
which
cases
the
miserable
little
being
was
usually
summoned
into
another
world
and
there
gathered
to
the
fathers
it
had
never
known
in
this
occasionally
when
there
was
some
more
than
usually
interesting
inquest
upon
a
parish
child
who
had
been
overlooked
in
turning
up
a
bedstead
or
inadvertently
scalded
to
death
when
there
happened
to
be
a
washing
though
the
latter
accident
was
very
scarce
anything
approaching
to
a
washing
being
of
rare
occurrence
in
the
farm
the
jury
would
take
it
into
their
heads
to
ask
troublesome
questions
or
the
parishioners
would
rebelliously
affix
their
signatures
to
a
remonstrance
but
these
impertinences
were
speedily
checked
by
the
evidence
of
the
surgeon
and
the
testimony
of
the
beadle
the
former
of
whom
had
always
opened
the
body
and
found
nothing
inside
which
was
very
probable
indeed
and
the
latter
of
whom
invariably
swore
whatever
the
parish
wanted
which
was
very
self
devotional
besides
the
board
made
periodical
pilgrimages
to
the
farm
and
always
sent
the
beadle
the
day
before
to
say
they
were
going
the
children
were
neat
and
clean
to
behold
when
they
went
and
what
more
would
the
people
have
it
cannot
be
expected
that
this
system
of
farming
would
produce
any
very
extraordinary
or
luxuriant
crop
oliver
twist
s
ninth
birthday
found
him
a
pale
thin
child
somewhat
diminutive
in
stature
and
decidedly
small
in
circumference
but
nature
or
inheritance
had
implanted
a
good
sturdy
spirit
in
oliver
s
breast
it
had
had
plenty
of
room
to
expand
thanks
to
the
spare
diet
of
the
establishment
and
perhaps
to
this
circumstance
may
be
attributed
his
having
any
ninth
birth
day
at
all
be
this
as
it
may
however
it
was
his
ninth
birthday
and
he
was
keeping
it
in
the
coal
cellar
with
a
select
party
of
two
other
young
gentleman
who
after
participating
with
him
in
a
sound
thrashing
had
been
locked
up
for
atrociously
presuming
to
be
hungry
when
mrs
mann
the
good
lady
of
the
house
was
unexpectedly
startled
by
the
apparition
of
mr
bumble
the
beadle
striving
to
undo
the
wicket
of
the
garden
gate
goodness
gracious
is
that
you
mr
bumble
sir
said
mrs
mann
thrusting
her
head
out
of
the
window
in
well
affected
ecstasies
of
joy
susan
take
oliver
and
them
two
brats
upstairs
and
wash
em
directly
my
heart
alive
mr
bumble
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
sure
ly
now
mr
bumble
was
a
fat
man
and
a
choleric
so
instead
of
responding
to
this
open
hearted
salutation
in
a
kindred
spirit
he
gave
the
little
wicket
a
tremendous
shake
and
then
bestowed
upon
it
a
kick
which
could
have
emanated
from
no
leg
but
a
beadle
s
lor
only
think
said
mrs
mann
running
out
for
the
three
boys
had
been
removed
by
this
time
only
think
of
that
that
i
should
have
forgotten
that
the
gate
was
bolted
on
the
inside
on
account
of
them
dear
children
walk
in
sir
walk
in
pray
mr
bumble
do
sir
although
this
invitation
was
accompanied
with
a
curtsey
that
might
have
softened
the
heart
of
a
church
warden
it
by
no
means
mollified
the
beadle
do
you
think
this
respectful
or
proper
conduct
mrs
mann
inquired
mr
bumble
grasping
his
cane
to
keep
the
parish
officers
a
waiting
at
your
garden
gate
when
they
come
here
upon
porochial
business
with
the
porochial
orphans
are
you
aweer
mrs
mann
that
you
are
as
i
may
say
a
porochial
delegate
and
a
stipendiary
i
m
sure
mr
bumble
that
i
was
only
a
telling
one
or
two
of
the
dear
children
as
is
so
fond
of
you
that
it
was
you
a
coming
replied
mrs
mann
with
great
humility
mr
bumble
had
a
great
idea
of
his
oratorical
powers
and
his
importance
he
had
displayed
the
one
and
vindicated
the
other
he
relaxed
well
well
mrs
mann
he
replied
in
a
calmer
tone
it
may
be
as
you
say
it
may
be
lead
the
way
in
mrs
mann
for
i
come
on
business
and
have
something
to
say
mrs
mann
ushered
the
beadle
into
a
small
parlour
with
a
brick
floor
placed
a
seat
for
him
and
officiously
deposited
his
cocked
hat
and
cane
on
the
table
before
him
mr
bumble
wiped
from
his
forehead
the
perspiration
which
his
walk
had
engendered
glanced
complacently
at
the
cocked
hat
and
smiled
yes
he
smiled
beadles
are
but
men
and
mr
bumble
smiled
now
don
t
you
be
offended
at
what
i
m
a
going
to
say
observed
mrs
mann
with
captivating
sweetness
you
ve
had
a
long
walk
you
know
or
i
wouldn
t
mention
it
now
will
you
take
a
little
drop
of
somethink
mr
bumble
not
a
drop
nor
a
drop
said
mr
bumble
waving
his
right
hand
in
a
dignified
but
placid
manner
i
think
you
will
said
mrs
mann
who
had
noticed
the
tone
of
the
refusal
and
the
gesture
that
had
accompanied
it
just
a
leetle
drop
with
a
little
cold
water
and
a
lump
of
sugar
mr
bumble
coughed
now
just
a
leetle
drop
said
mrs
mann
persuasively
what
is
it
inquired
the
beadle
why
it
s
what
i
m
obliged
to
keep
a
little
of
in
the
house
to
put
into
the
blessed
infants
daffy
when
they
ain
t
well
mr
bumble
replied
mrs
mann
as
she
opened
a
corner
cupboard
and
took
down
a
bottle
and
glass
it
s
gin
i
ll
not
deceive
you
mr
b
it
s
gin
do
you
give
the
children

mrs
mann
inquired
bumble
following
with
his
eyes
the
interesting
process
of
mixing
ah
bless
em
that
i
do
dear
as
it
is
replied
the
nurse
i
couldn
t
see
em
suffer
before
my
very
eyes
you
know
sir
no
said
mr
bumble
approvingly
no
you
could
not
you
are
a
humane
woman
mrs
mann
here
she
set
down
the
glass
i
shall
take
a
early
opportunity
of
mentioning
it
to
the
board
mrs
mann
he
drew
it
towards
him
you
feel
as
a
mother
mrs
mann
he
stirred
the
gin
and
water
i
i
drink
your
health
with
cheerfulness
mrs
mann
and
he
swallowed
half
of
it
and
now
about
business
said
the
beadle
taking
out
a
leathern
pocket
book
the
child
that
was
half
baptized
oliver
twist
is
nine
year
old
today
bless
him
interposed
mrs
mann
inflaming
her
left
eye
with
the
corner
of
her
apron
and
notwithstanding
a
offered
reward
of
ten
pound
which
was
afterwards
increased
to
twenty
pound
notwithstanding
the
most
superlative
and
i
may
say
supernat
ral
exertions
on
the
part
of
this
parish
said
bumble
we
have
never
been
able
to
discover
who
is
his
father
or
what
was
his
mother
s
settlement
name
or
condition
mrs
mann
raised
her
hands
in
astonishment
but
added
after
a
moment
s
reflection
how
comes
he
to
have
any
name
at
all
then
the
beadle
drew
himself
up
with
great
pride
and
said
i
inwented
it
you
mr
bumble
i
mrs
mann
we
name
our
fondlings
in
alphabetical
order
the
last
was
a
s
swubble
i
named
him
this
was
a
t
twist
i
named
him
the
next
one
comes
will
be
unwin
and
the
next
vilkins
i
have
got
names
ready
made
to
the
end
of
the
alphabet
and
all
the
way
through
it
again
when
we
come
to
z
why
you
re
quite
a
literary
character
sir
said
mrs
mann
well
well
said
the
beadle
evidently
gratified
with
the
compliment
perhaps
i
may
be
perhaps
i
may
be
mrs
mann
he
finished
the
gin
and
water
and
added
oliver
being
now
too
old
to
remain
here
the
board
have
determined
to
have
him
back
into
the
house
i
have
come
out
myself
to
take
him
there
so
let
me
see
him
at
once
i
ll
fetch
him
directly
said
mrs
mann
leaving
the
room
for
that
purpose
oliver
having
had
by
this
time
as
much
of
the
outer
coat
of
dirt
which
encrusted
his
face
and
hands
removed
as
could
be
scrubbed
off
in
one
washing
was
led
into
the
room
by
his
benevolent
protectress
make
a
bow
to
the
gentleman
oliver
said
mrs
mann
oliver
made
a
bow
which
was
divided
between
the
beadle
on
the
chair
and
the
cocked
hat
on
the
table
will
you
go
along
with
me
oliver
said
mr
bumble
in
a
majestic
voice
oliver
was
about
to
say
that
he
would
go
along
with
anybody
with
great
readiness
when
glancing
upward
he
caught
sight
of
mrs
mann
who
had
got
behind
the
beadle
s
chair
and
was
shaking
her
fist
at
him
with
a
furious
countenance
he
took
the
hint
at
once
for
the
fist
had
been
too
often
impressed
upon
his
body
not
to
be
deeply
impressed
upon
his
recollection
will
she
go
with
me
inquired
poor
oliver
no
she
can
t
replied
mr
bumble
but
she
ll
come
and
see
you
sometimes
this
was
no
very
great
consolation
to
the
child
young
as
he
was
however
he
had
sense
enough
to
make
a
feint
of
feeling
great
regret
at
going
away
it
was
no
very
difficult
matter
for
the
boy
to
call
tears
into
his
eyes
hunger
and
recent
ill
usage
are
great
assistants
if
you
want
to
cry
and
oliver
cried
very
naturally
indeed
mrs
mann
gave
him
a
thousand
embraces
and
what
oliver
wanted
a
great
deal
more
a
piece
of
bread
and
butter
lest
he
should
seem
too
hungry
when
he
got
to
the
workhouse
with
the
slice
of
bread
in
his
hand
and
the
little
brown
cloth
parish
cap
on
his
head
oliver
was
then
led
away
by
mr
bumble
from
the
wretched
home
where
one
kind
word
or
look
had
never
lighted
the
gloom
of
his
infant
years
and
yet
he
burst
into
an
agony
of
childish
grief
as
the
cottage
gate
closed
after
him
wretched
as
were
the
little
companions
in
misery
he
was
leaving
behind
they
were
the
only
friends
he
had
ever
known
and
a
sense
of
his
loneliness
in
the
great
wide
world
sank
into
the
child
s
heart
for
the
first
time
mr
bumble
walked
on
with
long
strides
little
oliver
firmly
grasping
his
gold
laced
cuff
trotted
beside
him
inquiring
at
the
end
of
every
quarter
of
a
mile
whether
they
were
nearly
there
to
these
interrogations
mr
bumble
returned
very
brief
and
snappish
replies
for
the
temporary
blandness
which
gin
and
water
awakens
in
some
bosoms
had
by
this
time
evaporated
and
he
was
once
again
a
beadle
oliver
had
not
been
within
the
walls
of
the
workhouse
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
had
scarcely
completed
the
demolition
of
a
second
slice
of
bread
when
mr
bumble
who
had
handed
him
over
to
the
care
of
an
old
woman
returned
and
telling
him
it
was
a
board
night
informed
him
that
the
board
had
said
he
was
to
appear
before
it
forthwith
not
having
a
very
clearly
defined
notion
of
what
a
live
board
was
oliver
was
rather
astounded
by
this
intelligence
and
was
not
quite
certain
whether
he
ought
to
laugh
or
cry
he
had
no
time
to
think
about
the
matter
however
for
mr
bumble
gave
him
a
tap
on
the
head
with
his
cane
to
wake
him
up
and
another
on
the
back
to
make
him
lively
and
bidding
him
to
follow
conducted
him
into
a
large
white
washed
room
where
eight
or
ten
fat
gentlemen
were
sitting
round
a
table
at
the
top
of
the
table
seated
in
an
arm
chair
rather
higher
than
the
rest
was
a
particularly
fat
gentleman
with
a
very
round
red
face
bow
to
the
board
said
bumble
oliver
brushed
away
two
or
three
tears
that
were
lingering
in
his
eyes
and
seeing
no
board
but
the
table
fortunately
bowed
to
that
what
s
your
name
boy
said
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
oliver
was
frightened
at
the
sight
of
so
many
gentlemen
which
made
him
tremble
and
the
beadle
gave
him
another
tap
behind
which
made
him
cry
these
two
causes
made
him
answer
in
a
very
low
and
hesitating
voice
whereupon
a
gentleman
in
a
white
waistcoat
said
he
was
a
fool
which
was
a
capital
way
of
raising
his
spirits
and
putting
him
quite
at
his
ease
boy
said
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
listen
to
me
you
know
you
re
an
orphan
i
suppose
what
s
that
sir
inquired
poor
oliver
the
boy
is
a
fool
i
thought
he
was
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
hush
said
the
gentleman
who
had
spoken
first
you
know
you
ve
got
no
father
or
mother
and
that
you
were
brought
up
by
the
parish
don
t
you
yes
sir
replied
oliver
weeping
bitterly
what
are
you
crying
for
inquired
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
and
to
be
sure
it
was
very
extraordinary
what
could
the
boy
be
crying
for
i
hope
you
say
your
prayers
every
night
said
another
gentleman
in
a
gruff
voice
and
pray
for
the
people
who
feed
you
and
take
care
of
you
like
a
christian
yes
sir
stammered
the
boy
the
gentleman
who
spoke
last
was
unconsciously
right
it
would
have
been
very
like
a
christian
and
a
marvellously
good
christian
too
if
oliver
had
prayed
for
the
people
who
fed
and
took
care
of
him
but
he
hadn
t
because
nobody
had
taught
him
well
you
have
come
here
to
be
educated
and
taught
a
useful
trade
said
the
red
faced
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
so
you
ll
begin
to
pick
oakum
tomorrow
morning
at
six
o
clock
added
the
surly
one
in
the
white
waistcoat
for
the
combination
of
both
these
blessings
in
the
one
simple
process
of
picking
oakum
oliver
bowed
low
by
the
direction
of
the
beadle
and
was
then
hurried
away
to
a
large
ward
where
on
a
rough
hard
bed
he
sobbed
himself
to
sleep
what
a
novel
illustration
of
the
tender
laws
of
england
they
let
the
paupers
go
to
sleep
poor
oliver
he
little
thought
as
he
lay
sleeping
in
happy
unconsciousness
of
all
around
him
that
the
board
had
that
very
day
arrived
at
a
decision
which
would
exercise
the
most
material
influence
over
all
his
future
fortunes
but
they
had
and
this
was
it
the
members
of
this
board
were
very
sage
deep
philosophical
men
and
when
they
came
to
turn
their
attention
to
the
workhouse
they
found
out
at
once
what
ordinary
folks
would
never
have
discovered
the
poor
people
liked
it
it
was
a
regular
place
of
public
entertainment
for
the
poorer
classes
a
tavern
where
there
was
nothing
to
pay
a
public
breakfast
dinner
tea
and
supper
all
the
year
round
a
brick
and
mortar
elysium
where
it
was
all
play
and
no
work
oho
said
the
board
looking
very
knowing
we
are
the
fellows
to
set
this
to
rights
we
ll
stop
it
all
in
no
time
so
they
established
the
rule
that
all
poor
people
should
have
the
alternative
for
they
would
compel
nobody
not
they
of
being
starved
by
a
gradual
process
in
the
house
or
by
a
quick
one
out
of
it
with
this
view
they
contracted
with
the
water
works
to
lay
on
an
unlimited
supply
of
water
and
with
a
corn
factory
to
supply
periodically
small
quantities
of
oatmeal
and
issued
three
meals
of
thin
gruel
a
day
with
an
onion
twice
a
week
and
half
a
roll
of
sundays
they
made
a
great
many
other
wise
and
humane
regulations
having
reference
to
the
ladies
which
it
is
not
necessary
to
repeat
kindly
undertook
to
divorce
poor
married
people
in
consequence
of
the
great
expense
of
a
suit
in
doctors
commons
and
instead
of
compelling
a
man
to
support
his
family
as
they
had
theretofore
done
took
his
family
away
from
him
and
made
him
a
bachelor
there
is
no
saying
how
many
applicants
for
relief
under
these
last
two
heads
might
have
started
up
in
all
classes
of
society
if
it
had
not
been
coupled
with
the
workhouse
but
the
board
were
long
headed
men
and
had
provided
for
this
difficulty
the
relief
was
inseparable
from
the
workhouse
and
the
gruel
and
that
frightened
people
for
the
first
six
months
after
oliver
twist
was
removed
the
system
was
in
full
operation
it
was
rather
expensive
at
first
in
consequence
of
the
increase
in
the
undertaker
s
bill
and
the
necessity
of
taking
in
the
clothes
of
all
the
paupers
which
fluttered
loosely
on
their
wasted
shrunken
forms
after
a
week
or
two
s
gruel
but
the
number
of
workhouse
inmates
got
thin
as
well
as
the
paupers
and
the
board
were
in
ecstasies
the
room
in
which
the
boys
were
fed
was
a
large
stone
hall
with
a
copper
at
one
end
out
of
which
the
master
dressed
in
an
apron
for
the
purpose
and
assisted
by
one
or
two
women
ladled
the
gruel
at
mealtimes
of
this
festive
composition
each
boy
had
one
porringer
and
no
more
except
on
occasions
of
great
public
rejoicing
when
he
had
two
ounces
and
a
quarter
of
bread
besides
the
bowls
never
wanted
washing
the
boys
polished
them
with
their
spoons
till
they
shone
again
and
when
they
had
performed
this
operation
which
never
took
very
long
the
spoons
being
nearly
as
large
as
the
bowls
they
would
sit
staring
at
the
copper
with
such
eager
eyes
as
if
they
could
have
devoured
the
very
bricks
of
which
it
was
composed
employing
themselves
meanwhile
in
sucking
their
fingers
most
assiduously
with
the
view
of
catching
up
any
stray
splashes
of
gruel
that
might
have
been
cast
thereon
boys
have
generally
excellent
appetites
oliver
twist
and
his
companions
suffered
the
tortures
of
slow
starvation
for
three
months
at
last
they
got
so
voracious
and
wild
with
hunger
that
one
boy
who
was
tall
for
his
age
and
hadn
t
been
used
to
that
sort
of
thing
for
his
father
had
kept
a
small
cook
shop
hinted
darkly
to
his
companions
that
unless
he
had
another
basin
of
gruel
per
diem
he
was
afraid
he
might
some
night
happen
to
eat
the
boy
who
slept
next
him
who
happened
to
be
a
weakly
youth
of
tender
age
he
had
a
wild
hungry
eye
and
they
implicitly
believed
him
a
council
was
held
lots
were
cast
who
should
walk
up
to
the
master
after
supper
that
evening
and
ask
for
more
and
it
fell
to
oliver
twist
the
evening
arrived
the
boys
took
their
places
the
master
in
his
cook
s
uniform
stationed
himself
at
the
copper
his
pauper
assistants
ranged
themselves
behind
him
the
gruel
was
served
out
and
a
long
grace
was
said
over
the
short
commons
the
gruel
disappeared
the
boys
whispered
each
other
and
winked
at
oliver
while
his
next
neighbors
nudged
him
child
as
he
was
he
was
desperate
with
hunger
and
reckless
with
misery
he
rose
from
the
table
and
advancing
to
the
master
basin
and
spoon
in
hand
said
somewhat
alarmed
at
his
own
temerity
please
sir
i
want
some
more
the
master
was
a
fat
healthy
man
but
he
turned
very
pale
he
gazed
in
stupefied
astonishment
on
the
small
rebel
for
some
seconds
and
then
clung
for
support
to
the
copper
the
assistants
were
paralysed
with
wonder
the
boys
with
fear
what
said
the
master
at
length
in
a
faint
voice
please
sir
replied
oliver
i
want
some
more
the
master
aimed
a
blow
at
oliver
s
head
with
the
ladle
pinioned
him
in
his
arm
and
shrieked
aloud
for
the
beadle
the
board
were
sitting
in
solemn
conclave
when
mr
bumble
rushed
into
the
room
in
great
excitement
and
addressing
the
gentleman
in
the
high
chair
said
mr
limbkins
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
oliver
twist
has
asked
for
more
there
was
a
general
start
horror
was
depicted
on
every
countenance
for
more
said
mr
limbkins
compose
yourself
bumble
and
answer
me
distinctly
do
i
understand
that
he
asked
for
more
after
he
had
eaten
the
supper
allotted
by
the
dietary
he
did
sir
replied
bumble
that
boy
will
be
hung
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
i
know
that
boy
will
be
hung
nobody
controverted
the
prophetic
gentleman
s
opinion
an
animated
discussion
took
place
oliver
was
ordered
into
instant
confinement
and
a
bill
was
next
morning
pasted
on
the
outside
of
the
gate
offering
a
reward
of
five
pounds
to
anybody
who
would
take
oliver
twist
off
the
hands
of
the
parish
in
other
words
five
pounds
and
oliver
twist
were
offered
to
any
man
or
woman
who
wanted
an
apprentice
to
any
trade
business
or
calling
i
never
was
more
convinced
of
anything
in
my
life
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
as
he
knocked
at
the
gate
and
read
the
bill
next
morning
i
never
was
more
convinced
of
anything
in
my
life
than
i
am
that
that
boy
will
come
to
be
hung
as
i
purpose
to
show
in
the
sequel
whether
the
white
waistcoated
gentleman
was
right
or
not
i
should
perhaps
mar
the
interest
of
this
narrative
supposing
it
to
possess
any
at
all
if
i
ventured
to
hint
just
yet
whether
the
life
of
oliver
twist
had
this
violent
termination
or
no
chapter
iii
relates
how
oliver
twist
was
very
near
getting
a
place
which
would
not
have
been
a
sinecure
for
a
week
after
the
commission
of
the
impious
and
profane
offence
of
asking
for
more
oliver
remained
a
close
prisoner
in
the
dark
and
solitary
room
to
which
he
had
been
consigned
by
the
wisdom
and
mercy
of
the
board
it
appears
at
first
sight
not
unreasonable
to
suppose
that
if
he
had
entertained
a
becoming
feeling
of
respect
for
the
prediction
of
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
he
would
have
established
that
sage
individual
s
prophetic
character
once
and
for
ever
by
tying
one
end
of
his
pocket
handkerchief
to
a
hook
in
the
wall
and
attaching
himself
to
the
other
to
the
performance
of
this
feat
however
there
was
one
obstacle
namely
that
pocket
handkerchiefs
being
decided
articles
of
luxury
had
been
for
all
future
times
and
ages
removed
from
the
noses
of
paupers
by
the
express
order
of
the
board
in
council
assembled
solemnly
given
and
pronounced
under
their
hands
and
seals
there
was
a
still
greater
obstacle
in
oliver
s
youth
and
childishness
he
only
cried
bitterly
all
day
and
when
the
long
dismal
night
came
on
spread
his
little
hands
before
his
eyes
to
shut
out
the
darkness
and
crouching
in
the
corner
tried
to
sleep
ever
and
anon
waking
with
a
start
and
tremble
and
drawing
himself
closer
and
closer
to
the
wall
as
if
to
feel
even
its
cold
hard
surface
were
a
protection
in
the
gloom
and
loneliness
which
surrounded
him
let
it
not
be
supposed
by
the
enemies
of
the
system
that
during
the
period
of
his
solitary
incarceration
oliver
was
denied
the
benefit
of
exercise
the
pleasure
of
society
or
the
advantages
of
religious
consolation
as
for
exercise
it
was
nice
cold
weather
and
he
was
allowed
to
perform
his
ablutions
every
morning
under
the
pump
in
a
stone
yard
in
the
presence
of
mr
bumble
who
prevented
his
catching
cold
and
caused
a
tingling
sensation
to
pervade
his
frame
by
repeated
applications
of
the
cane
as
for
society
he
was
carried
every
other
day
into
the
hall
where
the
boys
dined
and
there
sociably
flogged
as
a
public
warning
and
example
and
so
far
from
being
denied
the
advantages
of
religious
consolation
he
was
kicked
into
the
same
apartment
every
evening
at
prayer
time
and
there
permitted
to
listen
to
and
console
his
mind
with
a
general
supplication
of
the
boys
containing
a
special
clause
therein
inserted
by
authority
of
the
board
in
which
they
entreated
to
be
made
good
virtuous
contented
and
obedient
and
to
be
guarded
from
the
sins
and
vices
of
oliver
twist
whom
the
supplication
distinctly
set
forth
to
be
under
the
exclusive
patronage
and
protection
of
the
powers
of
wickedness
and
an
article
direct
from
the
manufactory
of
the
very
devil
himself
it
chanced
one
morning
while
oliver
s
affairs
were
in
this
auspicious
and
comfortable
state
that
mr
gamfield
chimney
sweep
went
his
way
down
the
high
street
deeply
cogitating
in
his
mind
his
ways
and
means
of
paying
certain
arrears
of
rent
for
which
his
landlord
had
become
rather
pressing
mr
gamfield
s
most
sanguine
estimate
of
his
finances
could
not
raise
them
within
full
five
pounds
of
the
desired
amount
and
in
a
species
of
arithmetical
desperation
he
was
alternately
cudgelling
his
brains
and
his
donkey
when
passing
the
workhouse
his
eyes
encountered
the
bill
on
the
gate
wo
o
said
mr
gamfield
to
the
donkey
the
donkey
was
in
a
state
of
profound
abstraction
wondering
probably
whether
he
was
destined
to
be
regaled
with
a
cabbage
stalk
or
two
when
he
had
disposed
of
the
two
sacks
of
soot
with
which
the
little
cart
was
laden
so
without
noticing
the
word
of
command
he
jogged
onward
mr
gamfield
growled
a
fierce
imprecation
on
the
donkey
generally
but
more
particularly
on
his
eyes
and
running
after
him
bestowed
a
blow
on
his
head
which
would
inevitably
have
beaten
in
any
skull
but
a
donkey
s
then
catching
hold
of
the
bridle
he
gave
his
jaw
a
sharp
wrench
by
way
of
gentle
reminder
that
he
was
not
his
own
master
and
by
these
means
turned
him
round
he
then
gave
him
another
blow
on
the
head
just
to
stun
him
till
he
came
back
again
having
completed
these
arrangements
he
walked
up
to
the
gate
to
read
the
bill
the
gentleman
with
the
white
waistcoat
was
standing
at
the
gate
with
his
hands
behind
him
after
having
delivered
himself
of
some
profound
sentiments
in
the
board
room
having
witnessed
the
little
dispute
between
mr
gamfield
and
the
donkey
he
smiled
joyously
when
that
person
came
up
to
read
the
bill
for
he
saw
at
once
that
mr
gamfield
was
exactly
the
sort
of
master
oliver
twist
wanted
mr
gamfield
smiled
too
as
he
perused
the
document
for
five
pounds
was
just
the
sum
he
had
been
wishing
for
and
as
to
the
boy
with
which
it
was
encumbered
mr
gamfield
knowing
what
the
dietary
of
the
workhouse
was
well
knew
he
would
be
a
nice
small
pattern
just
the
very
thing
for
register
stoves
so
he
spelt
the
bill
through
again
from
beginning
to
end
and
then
touching
his
fur
cap
in
token
of
humility
accosted
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
this
here
boy
sir
wot
the
parish
wants
to
prentis
said
mr
gamfield
ay
my
man
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
with
a
condescending
smile
what
of
him
if
the
parish
vould
like
him
to
learn
a
right
pleasant
trade
in
a
good
spectable
chimbley
sweepin
bisness
said
mr
gamfield
i
wants
a
prentis
and
i
am
ready
to
take
him
walk
in
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
mr
gamfield
having
lingered
behind
to
give
the
donkey
another
blow
on
the
head
and
another
wrench
of
the
jaw
as
a
caution
not
to
run
away
in
his
absence
followed
the
gentleman
with
the
white
waistcoat
into
the
room
where
oliver
had
first
seen
him
it
s
a
nasty
trade
said
mr
limbkins
when
gamfield
had
again
stated
his
wish
young
boys
have
been
smothered
in
chimneys
before
now
said
another
gentleman
that
s
acause
they
damped
the
straw
afore
they
lit
it
in
the
chimbley
to
make
em
come
down
again
said
gamfield
that
s
all
smoke
and
no
blaze
vereas
smoke
ain
t
o
no
use
at
all
in
making
a
boy
come
down
for
it
only
sinds
him
to
sleep
and
that
s
wot
he
likes
boys
is
wery
obstinit
and
wery
lazy
gen
l
men
and
there
s
nothink
like
a
good
hot
blaze
to
make
em
come
down
vith
a
run
it
s
humane
too
gen
l
men
acause
even
if
they
ve
stuck
in
the
chimbley
roasting
their
feet
makes
em
struggle
to
hextricate
theirselves
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
appeared
very
much
amused
by
this
explanation
but
his
mirth
was
speedily
checked
by
a
look
from
mr
limbkins
the
board
then
proceeded
to
converse
among
themselves
for
a
few
minutes
but
in
so
low
a
tone
that
the
words
saving
of
expenditure
looked
well
in
the
accounts
have
a
printed
report
published
were
alone
audible
these
only
chanced
to
be
heard
indeed
on
account
of
their
being
very
frequently
repeated
with
great
emphasis
at
length
the
whispering
ceased
and
the
members
of
the
board
having
resumed
their
seats
and
their
solemnity
mr
limbkins
said
we
have
considered
your
proposition
and
we
don
t
approve
of
it
not
at
all
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
decidedly
not
added
the
other
members
as
mr
gamfield
did
happen
to
labour
under
the
slight
imputation
of
having
bruised
three
or
four
boys
to
death
already
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
board
had
perhaps
in
some
unaccountable
freak
taken
it
into
their
heads
that
this
extraneous
circumstance
ought
to
influence
their
proceedings
it
was
very
unlike
their
general
mode
of
doing
business
if
they
had
but
still
as
he
had
no
particular
wish
to
revive
the
rumour
he
twisted
his
cap
in
his
hands
and
walked
slowly
from
the
table
so
you
won
t
let
me
have
him
gen
l
men
said
mr
gamfield
pausing
near
the
door
no
replied
mr
limbkins
at
least
as
it
s
a
nasty
business
we
think
you
ought
to
take
something
less
than
the
premium
we
offered
mr
gamfield
s
countenance
brightened
as
with
a
quick
step
he
returned
to
the
table
and
said
what
ll
you
give
gen
l
men
come
don
t
be
too
hard
on
a
poor
man
what
ll
you
give
i
should
say
three
pound
ten
was
plenty
said
mr
limbkins
ten
shillings
too
much
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
come
said
gamfield
say
four
pound
gen
l
men
say
four
pound
and
you
ve
got
rid
of
him
for
good
and
all
there
three
pound
ten
repeated
mr
limbkins
firmly
come
i
ll
split
the
diff
erence
gen
l
men
urged
gamfield
three
pound
fifteen
not
a
farthing
more
was
the
firm
reply
of
mr
limbkins
you
re
desperate
hard
upon
me
gen
l
men
said
gamfield
wavering
pooh
pooh
nonsense
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
he
d
be
cheap
with
nothing
at
all
as
a
premium
take
him
you
silly
fellow
he
s
just
the
boy
for
you
he
wants
the
stick
now
and
then
it
ll
do
him
good
and
his
board
needn
t
come
very
expensive
for
he
hasn
t
been
overfed
since
he
was
born
ha
ha
ha
mr
gamfield
gave
an
arch
look
at
the
faces
round
the
table
and
observing
a
smile
on
all
of
them
gradually
broke
into
a
smile
himself
the
bargain
was
made
mr
bumble
was
at
once
instructed
that
oliver
twist
and
his
indentures
were
to
be
conveyed
before
the
magistrate
for
signature
and
approval
that
very
afternoon
in
pursuance
of
this
determination
little
oliver
to
his
excessive
astonishment
was
released
from
bondage
and
ordered
to
put
himself
into
a
clean
shirt
he
had
hardly
achieved
this
very
unusual
gymnastic
performance
when
mr
bumble
brought
him
with
his
own
hands
a
basin
of
gruel
and
the
holiday
allowance
of
two
ounces
and
a
quarter
of
bread
at
this
tremendous
sight
oliver
began
to
cry
very
piteously
thinking
not
unnaturally
that
the
board
must
have
determined
to
kill
him
for
some
useful
purpose
or
they
never
would
have
begun
to
fatten
him
up
in
that
way
don
t
make
your
eyes
red
oliver
but
eat
your
food
and
be
thankful
said
mr
bumble
in
a
tone
of
impressive
pomposity
you
re
a
going
to
be
made
a
prentice
of
oliver
a
prentice
sir
said
the
child
trembling
yes
oliver
said
mr
bumble
the
kind
and
blessed
gentleman
which
is
so
many
parents
to
you
oliver
when
you
have
none
of
your
own
are
a
going
to
prentice
you
and
to
set
you
up
in
life
and
make
a
man
of
you
although
the
expense
to
the
parish
is
three
pound
ten
three
pound
ten
oliver
seventy
shillins
one
hundred
and
forty
sixpences
and
all
for
a
naughty
orphan
which
nobody
can
t
love
as
mr
bumble
paused
to
take
breath
after
delivering
this
address
in
an
awful
voice
the
tears
rolled
down
the
poor
child
s
face
and
he
sobbed
bitterly
come
said
mr
bumble
somewhat
less
pompously
for
it
was
gratifying
to
his
feelings
to
observe
the
effect
his
eloquence
had
produced
come
oliver
wipe
your
eyes
with
the
cuffs
of
your
jacket
and
don
t
cry
into
your
gruel
that
s
a
very
foolish
action
oliver
it
certainly
was
for
there
was
quite
enough
water
in
it
already
on
their
way
to
the
magistrate
mr
bumble
instructed
oliver
that
all
he
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
look
very
happy
and
say
when
the
gentleman
asked
him
if
he
wanted
to
be
apprenticed
that
he
should
like
it
very
much
indeed
both
of
which
injunctions
oliver
promised
to
obey
the
rather
as
mr
bumble
threw
in
a
gentle
hint
that
if
he
failed
in
either
particular
there
was
no
telling
what
would
be
done
to
him
when
they
arrived
at
the
office
he
was
shut
up
in
a
little
room
by
himself
and
admonished
by
mr
bumble
to
stay
there
until
he
came
back
to
fetch
him
there
the
boy
remained
with
a
palpitating
heart
for
half
an
hour
at
the
expiration
of
which
time
mr
bumble
thrust
in
his
head
unadorned
with
the
cocked
hat
and
said
aloud
now
oliver
my
dear
come
to
the
gentleman
as
mr
bumble
said
this
he
put
on
a
grim
and
threatening
look
and
added
in
a
low
voice
mind
what
i
told
you
you
young
rascal
oliver
stared
innocently
in
mr
bumble
s
face
at
this
somewhat
contradictory
style
of
address
but
that
gentleman
prevented
his
offering
any
remark
thereupon
by
leading
him
at
once
into
an
adjoining
room
the
door
of
which
was
open
it
was
a
large
room
with
a
great
window
behind
a
desk
sat
two
old
gentleman
with
powdered
heads
one
of
whom
was
reading
the
newspaper
while
the
other
was
perusing
with
the
aid
of
a
pair
of
tortoise
shell
spectacles
a
small
piece
of
parchment
which
lay
before
him
mr
limbkins
was
standing
in
front
of
the
desk
on
one
side
and
mr
gamfield
with
a
partially
washed
face
on
the
other
while
two
or
three
bluff
looking
men
in
top
boots
were
lounging
about
the
old
gentleman
with
the
spectacles
gradually
dozed
off
over
the
little
bit
of
parchment
and
there
was
a
short
pause
after
oliver
had
been
stationed
by
mr
bumble
in
front
of
the
desk
this
is
the
boy
your
worship
said
mr
bumble
the
old
gentleman
who
was
reading
the
newspaper
raised
his
head
for
a
moment
and
pulled
the
other
old
gentleman
by
the
sleeve
whereupon
the
last
mentioned
old
gentleman
woke
up
oh
is
this
the
boy
said
the
old
gentleman
this
is
him
sir
replied
mr
bumble
bow
to
the
magistrate
my
dear
oliver
roused
himself
and
made
his
best
obeisance
he
had
been
wondering
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
magistrates
powder
whether
all
boards
were
born
with
that
white
stuff
on
their
heads
and
were
boards
from
thenceforth
on
that
account
well
said
the
old
gentleman
i
suppose
he
s
fond
of
chimney
sweeping
he
doats
on
it
your
worship
replied
bumble
giving
oliver
a
sly
pinch
to
intimate
that
he
had
better
not
say
he
didn
t
and
he
will
be
a
sweep
will
he
inquired
the
old
gentleman
if
we
was
to
bind
him
to
any
other
trade
tomorrow
he
d
run
away
simultaneous
your
worship
replied
bumble
and
this
man
that
s
to
be
his
master
you
sir
you
ll
treat
him
well
and
feed
him
and
do
all
that
sort
of
thing
will
you
said
the
old
gentleman
when
i
says
i
will
i
means
i
will
replied
mr
gamfield
doggedly
you
re
a
rough
speaker
my
friend
but
you
look
an
honest
open
hearted
man
said
the
old
gentleman
turning
his
spectacles
in
the
direction
of
the
candidate
for
oliver
s
premium
whose
villainous
countenance
was
a
regular
stamped
receipt
for
cruelty
but
the
magistrate
was
half
blind
and
half
childish
so
he
couldn
t
reasonably
be
expected
to
discern
what
other
people
did
i
hope
i
am
sir
said
mr
gamfield
with
an
ugly
leer
i
have
no
doubt
you
are
my
friend
replied
the
old
gentleman
fixing
his
spectacles
more
firmly
on
his
nose
and
looking
about
him
for
the
inkstand
it
was
the
critical
moment
of
oliver
s
fate
if
the
inkstand
had
been
where
the
old
gentleman
thought
it
was
he
would
have
dipped
his
pen
into
it
and
signed
the
indentures
and
oliver
would
have
been
straightway
hurried
off
but
as
it
chanced
to
be
immediately
under
his
nose
it
followed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
he
looked
all
over
his
desk
for
it
without
finding
it
and
happening
in
the
course
of
his
search
to
look
straight
before
him
his
gaze
encountered
the
pale
and
terrified
face
of
oliver
twist
who
despite
all
the
admonitory
looks
and
pinches
of
bumble
was
regarding
the
repulsive
countenance
of
his
future
master
with
a
mingled
expression
of
horror
and
fear
too
palpable
to
be
mistaken
even
by
a
half
blind
magistrate
the
old
gentleman
stopped
laid
down
his
pen
and
looked
from
oliver
to
mr
limbkins
who
attempted
to
take
snuff
with
a
cheerful
and
unconcerned
aspect
my
boy
said
the
old
gentleman
you
look
pale
and
alarmed
what
is
the
matter
stand
a
little
away
from
him
beadle
said
the
other
magistrate
laying
aside
the
paper
and
leaning
forward
with
an
expression
of
interest
now
boy
tell
us
what
s
the
matter
don
t
be
afraid
oliver
fell
on
his
knees
and
clasping
his
hands
together
prayed
that
they
would
order
him
back
to
the
dark
room
that
they
would
starve
him
beat
him
kill
him
if
they
pleased
rather
than
send
him
away
with
that
dreadful
man
well
said
mr
bumble
raising
his
hands
and
eyes
with
most
impressive
solemnity
well
of
all
the
artful
and
designing
orphans
that
ever
i
see
oliver
you
are
one
of
the
most
bare
facedest
hold
your
tongue
beadle
said
the
second
old
gentleman
when
mr
bumble
had
given
vent
to
this
compound
adjective
i
beg
your
worship
s
pardon
said
mr
bumble
incredulous
of
having
heard
aright
did
your
worship
speak
to
me
yes
hold
your
tongue
mr
bumble
was
stupefied
with
astonishment
a
beadle
ordered
to
hold
his
tongue
a
moral
revolution
the
old
gentleman
in
the
tortoise
shell
spectacles
looked
at
his
companion
he
nodded
significantly
we
refuse
to
sanction
these
indentures
said
the
old
gentleman
tossing
aside
the
piece
of
parchment
as
he
spoke
i
hope
stammered
mr
limbkins
i
hope
the
magistrates
will
not
form
the
opinion
that
the
authorities
have
been
guilty
of
any
improper
conduct
on
the
unsupported
testimony
of
a
child
the
magistrates
are
not
called
upon
to
pronounce
any
opinion
on
the
matter
said
the
second
old
gentleman
sharply
take
the
boy
back
to
the
workhouse
and
treat
him
kindly
he
seems
to
want
it
that
same
evening
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
most
positively
and
decidedly
affirmed
not
only
that
oliver
would
be
hung
but
that
he
would
be
drawn
and
quartered
into
the
bargain
mr
bumble
shook
his
head
with
gloomy
mystery
and
said
he
wished
he
might
come
to
good
whereunto
mr
gamfield
replied
that
he
wished
he
might
come
to
him
which
although
he
agreed
with
the
beadle
in
most
matters
would
seem
to
be
a
wish
of
a
totally
opposite
description
the
next
morning
the
public
were
once
informed
that
oliver
twist
was
again
to
let
and
that
five
pounds
would
be
paid
to
anybody
who
would
take
possession
of
him
chapter
iv
oliver
being
offered
another
place
makes
his
first
entry
into
public
life
in
great
families
when
an
advantageous
place
cannot
be
obtained
either
in
possession
reversion
remainder
or
expectancy
for
the
young
man
who
is
growing
up
it
is
a
very
general
custom
to
send
him
to
sea
the
board
in
imitation
of
so
wise
and
salutary
an
example
took
counsel
together
on
the
expediency
of
shipping
off
oliver
twist
in
some
small
trading
vessel
bound
to
a
good
unhealthy
port
this
suggested
itself
as
the
very
best
thing
that
could
possibly
be
done
with
him
the
probability
being
that
the
skipper
would
flog
him
to
death
in
a
playful
mood
some
day
after
dinner
or
would
knock
his
brains
out
with
an
iron
bar
both
pastimes
being
as
is
pretty
generally
known
very
favourite
and
common
recreations
among
gentleman
of
that
class
the
more
the
case
presented
itself
to
the
board
in
this
point
of
view
the
more
manifold
the
advantages
of
the
step
appeared
so
they
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
way
of
providing
for
oliver
effectually
was
to
send
him
to
sea
without
delay
mr
bumble
had
been
despatched
to
make
various
preliminary
inquiries
with
the
view
of
finding
out
some
captain
or
other
who
wanted
a
cabin
boy
without
any
friends
and
was
returning
to
the
workhouse
to
communicate
the
result
of
his
mission
when
he
encountered
at
the
gate
no
less
a
person
than
mr
sowerberry
the
parochial
undertaker
mr
sowerberry
was
a
tall
gaunt
large
jointed
man
attired
in
a
suit
of
threadbare
black
with
darned
cotton
stockings
of
the
same
colour
and
shoes
to
answer
his
features
were
not
naturally
intended
to
wear
a
smiling
aspect
but
he
was
in
general
rather
given
to
professional
jocosity
his
step
was
elastic
and
his
face
betokened
inward
pleasantry
as
he
advanced
to
mr
bumble
and
shook
him
cordially
by
the
hand
i
have
taken
the
measure
of
the
two
women
that
died
last
night
mr
bumble
said
the
undertaker
you
ll
make
your
fortune
mr
sowerberry
said
the
beadle
as
he
thrust
his
thumb
and
forefinger
into
the
proffered
snuff
box
of
the
undertaker
which
was
an
ingenious
little
model
of
a
patent
coffin
i
say
you
ll
make
your
fortune
mr
sowerberry
repeated
mr
bumble
tapping
the
undertaker
on
the
shoulder
in
a
friendly
manner
with
his
cane
think
so
said
the
undertaker
in
a
tone
which
half
admitted
and
half
disputed
the
probability
of
the
event
the
prices
allowed
by
the
board
are
very
small
mr
bumble
so
are
the
coffins
replied
the
beadle
with
precisely
as
near
an
approach
to
a
laugh
as
a
great
official
ought
to
indulge
in
mr
sowerberry
was
much
tickled
at
this
as
of
course
he
ought
to
be
and
laughed
a
long
time
without
cessation
well
well
mr
bumble
he
said
at
length
there
s
no
denying
that
since
the
new
system
of
feeding
has
come
in
the
coffins
are
something
narrower
and
more
shallow
than
they
used
to
be
but
we
must
have
some
profit
mr
bumble
well
seasoned
timber
is
an
expensive
article
sir
and
all
the
iron
handles
come
by
canal
from
birmingham
well
well
said
mr
bumble
every
trade
has
its
drawbacks
a
fair
profit
is
of
course
allowable
of
course
of
course
replied
the
undertaker
and
if
i
don
t
get
a
profit
upon
this
or
that
particular
article
why
i
make
it
up
in
the
long
run
you
see
he
he
he
just
so
said
mr
bumble
though
i
must
say
continued
the
undertaker
resuming
the
current
of
observations
which
the
beadle
had
interrupted
though
i
must
say
mr
bumble
that
i
have
to
contend
against
one
very
great
disadvantage
which
is
that
all
the
stout
people
go
off
the
quickest
the
people
who
have
been
better
off
and
have
paid
rates
for
many
years
are
the
first
to
sink
when
they
come
into
the
house
and
let
me
tell
you
mr
bumble
that
three
or
four
inches
over
one
s
calculation
makes
a
great
hole
in
one
s
profits
especially
when
one
has
a
family
to
provide
for
sir
as
mr
sowerberry
said
this
with
the
becoming
indignation
of
an
ill
used
man
and
as
mr
bumble
felt
that
it
rather
tended
to
convey
a
reflection
on
the
honour
of
the
parish
the
latter
gentleman
thought
it
advisable
to
change
the
subject
oliver
twist
being
uppermost
in
his
mind
he
made
him
his
theme
by
the
bye
said
mr
bumble
you
don
t
know
anybody
who
wants
a
boy
do
you
a
porochial
prentis
who
is
at
present
a
dead
weight
a
millstone
as
i
may
say
round
the
porochial
throat
liberal
terms
mr
sowerberry
liberal
terms
as
mr
bumble
spoke
he
raised
his
cane
to
the
bill
above
him
and
gave
three
distinct
raps
upon
the
words
five
pounds
which
were
printed
thereon
in
roman
capitals
of
gigantic
size
gadso
said
the
undertaker
taking
mr
bumble
by
the
gilt
edged
lappel
of
his
official
coat
that
s
just
the
very
thing
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
you
know
dear
me
what
a
very
elegant
button
this
is
mr
bumble
i
never
noticed
it
before
yes
i
think
it
rather
pretty
said
the
beadle
glancing
proudly
downwards
at
the
large
brass
buttons
which
embellished
his
coat
the
die
is
the
same
as
the
porochial
seal
the
good
samaritan
healing
the
sick
and
bruised
man
the
board
presented
it
to
me
on
newyear
s
morning
mr
sowerberry
i
put
it
on
i
remember
for
the
first
time
to
attend
the
inquest
on
that
reduced
tradesman
who
died
in
a
doorway
at
midnight
i
recollect
said
the
undertaker
the
jury
brought
it
in
died
from
exposure
to
the
cold
and
want
of
the
common
necessaries
of
life
didn
t
they
mr
bumble
nodded
and
they
made
it
a
special
verdict
i
think
said
the
undertaker
by
adding
some
words
to
the
effect
that
if
the
relieving
officer
had
tush
foolery
interposed
the
beadle
if
the
board
attended
to
all
the
nonsense
that
ignorant
jurymen
talk
they
d
have
enough
to
do
very
true
said
the
undertaker
they
would
indeed
juries
said
mr
bumble
grasping
his
cane
tightly
as
was
his
wont
when
working
into
a
passion
juries
is
ineddicated
vulgar
grovelling
wretches
so
they
are
said
the
undertaker
they
haven
t
no
more
philosophy
nor
political
economy
about
em
than
that
said
the
beadle
snapping
his
fingers
contemptuously
no
more
they
have
acquiesced
the
undertaker
i
despise
em
said
the
beadle
growing
very
red
in
the
face
so
do
i
rejoined
the
undertaker
and
i
only
wish
we
d
a
jury
of
the
independent
sort
in
the
house
for
a
week
or
two
said
the
beadle
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
board
would
soon
bring
their
spirit
down
for
em
let
em
alone
for
that
replied
the
undertaker
so
saying
he
smiled
approvingly
to
calm
the
rising
wrath
of
the
indignant
parish
officer
mr
bumble
lifted
off
his
cocked
hat
took
a
handkerchief
from
the
inside
of
the
crown
wiped
from
his
forehead
the
perspiration
which
his
rage
had
engendered
fixed
the
cocked
hat
on
again
and
turning
to
the
undertaker
said
in
a
calmer
voice
well
what
about
the
boy
oh
replied
the
undertaker
why
you
know
mr
bumble
i
pay
a
good
deal
towards
the
poor
s
rates
hem
said
mr
bumble
well
well
replied
the
undertaker
i
was
thinking
that
if
i
pay
so
much
towards
em
i
ve
a
right
to
get
as
much
out
of
em
as
i
can
mr
bumble
and
so
i
think
i
ll
take
the
boy
myself
mr
bumble
grasped
the
undertaker
by
the
arm
and
led
him
into
the
building
mr
sowerberry
was
closeted
with
the
board
for
five
minutes
and
it
was
arranged
that
oliver
should
go
to
him
that
evening
upon
liking
a
phrase
which
means
in
the
case
of
a
parish
apprentice
that
if
the
master
find
upon
a
short
trial
that
he
can
get
enough
work
out
of
a
boy
without
putting
too
much
food
into
him
he
shall
have
him
for
a
term
of
years
to
do
what
he
likes
with
when
little
oliver
was
taken
before
the
gentlemen
that
evening
and
informed
that
he
was
to
go
that
night
as
general
house
lad
to
a
coffin
maker
s
and
that
if
he
complained
of
his
situation
or
ever
came
back
to
the
parish
again
he
would
be
sent
to
sea
there
to
be
drowned
or
knocked
on
the
head
as
the
case
might
be
he
evinced
so
little
emotion
that
they
by
common
consent
pronounced
him
a
hardened
young
rascal
and
ordered
mr
bumble
to
remove
him
forthwith
now
although
it
was
very
natural
that
the
board
of
all
people
in
the
world
should
feel
in
a
great
state
of
virtuous
astonishment
and
horror
at
the
smallest
tokens
of
want
of
feeling
on
the
part
of
anybody
they
were
rather
out
in
this
particular
instance
the
simple
fact
was
that
oliver
instead
of
possessing
too
little
feeling
possessed
rather
too
much
and
was
in
a
fair
way
of
being
reduced
for
life
to
a
state
of
brutal
stupidity
and
sullenness
by
the
ill
usage
he
had
received
he
heard
the
news
of
his
destination
in
perfect
silence
and
having
had
his
luggage
put
into
his
hand
which
was
not
very
difficult
to
carry
inasmuch
as
it
was
all
comprised
within
the
limits
of
a
brown
paper
parcel
about
half
a
foot
square
by
three
inches
deep
he
pulled
his
cap
over
his
eyes
and
once
more
attaching
himself
to
mr
bumble
s
coat
cuff
was
led
away
by
that
dignitary
to
a
new
scene
of
suffering
for
some
time
mr
bumble
drew
oliver
along
without
notice
or
remark
for
the
beadle
carried
his
head
very
erect
as
a
beadle
always
should
and
it
being
a
windy
day
little
oliver
was
completely
enshrouded
by
the
skirts
of
mr
bumble
s
coat
as
they
blew
open
and
disclosed
to
great
advantage
his
flapped
waistcoat
and
drab
plush
knee
breeches
as
they
drew
near
to
their
destination
however
mr
bumble
thought
it
expedient
to
look
down
and
see
that
the
boy
was
in
good
order
for
inspection
by
his
new
master
which
he
accordingly
did
with
a
fit
and
becoming
air
of
gracious
patronage
oliver
said
mr
bumble
yes
sir
replied
oliver
in
a
low
tremulous
voice
pull
that
cap
off
your
eyes
and
hold
up
your
head
sir
although
oliver
did
as
he
was
desired
at
once
and
passed
the
back
of
his
unoccupied
hand
briskly
across
his
eyes
he
left
a
tear
in
them
when
he
looked
up
at
his
conductor
as
mr
bumble
gazed
sternly
upon
him
it
rolled
down
his
cheek
it
was
followed
by
another
and
another
the
child
made
a
strong
effort
but
it
was
an
unsuccessful
one
withdrawing
his
other
hand
from
mr
bumble
s
he
covered
his
face
with
both
and
wept
until
the
tears
sprung
out
from
between
his
chin
and
bony
fingers
well
exclaimed
mr
bumble
stopping
short
and
darting
at
his
little
charge
a
look
of
intense
malignity
well
of
all
the
ungratefullest
and
worst
disposed
boys
as
ever
i
see
oliver
you
are
the
no
no
sir
sobbed
oliver
clinging
to
the
hand
which
held
the
well
known
cane
no
no
sir
i
will
be
good
indeed
indeed
indeed
i
will
sir
i
am
a
very
little
boy
sir
and
it
is
so
so
so
what
inquired
mr
bumble
in
amazement
so
lonely
sir
so
very
lonely
cried
the
child
everybody
hates
me
oh
sir
don
t
don
t
pray
be
cross
to
me
the
child
beat
his
hand
upon
his
heart
and
looked
in
his
companion
s
face
with
tears
of
real
agony
mr
bumble
regarded
oliver
s
piteous
and
helpless
look
with
some
astonishment
for
a
few
seconds
hemmed
three
or
four
times
in
a
husky
manner
and
after
muttering
something
about
that
troublesome
cough
bade
oliver
dry
his
eyes
and
be
a
good
boy
then
once
more
taking
his
hand
he
walked
on
with
him
in
silence
the
undertaker
who
had
just
put
up
the
shutters
of
his
shop
was
making
some
entries
in
his
day
book
by
the
light
of
a
most
appropriate
dismal
candle
when
mr
bumble
entered
aha
said
the
undertaker
looking
up
from
the
book
and
pausing
in
the
middle
of
a
word
is
that
you
bumble
no
one
else
mr
sowerberry
replied
the
beadle
here
i
ve
brought
the
boy
oliver
made
a
bow
oh
that
s
the
boy
is
it
said
the
undertaker
raising
the
candle
above
his
head
to
get
a
better
view
of
oliver
mrs
sowerberry
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
come
here
a
moment
my
dear
mrs
sowerberry
emerged
from
a
little
room
behind
the
shop
and
presented
the
form
of
a
short
thin
squeezed
up
woman
with
a
vixenish
countenance
my
dear
said
mr
sowerberry
deferentially
this
is
the
boy
from
the
workhouse
that
i
told
you
of
oliver
bowed
again
dear
me
said
the
undertaker
s
wife
he
s
very
small
why
he
is
rather
small
replied
mr
bumble
looking
at
oliver
as
if
it
were
his
fault
that
he
was
no
bigger
he
is
small
there
s
no
denying
it
but
he
ll
grow
mrs
sowerberry
he
ll
grow
ah
i
dare
say
he
will
replied
the
lady
pettishly
on
our
victuals
and
our
drink
i
see
no
saving
in
parish
children
not
i
for
they
always
cost
more
to
keep
than
they
re
worth
however
men
always
think
they
know
best
there
get
downstairs
little
bag
o
bones
with
this
the
undertaker
s
wife
opened
a
side
door
and
pushed
oliver
down
a
steep
flight
of
stairs
into
a
stone
cell
damp
and
dark
forming
the
ante
room
to
the
coal
cellar
and
denominated
kitchen
wherein
sat
a
slatternly
girl
in
shoes
down
at
heel
and
blue
worsted
stockings
very
much
out
of
repair
here
charlotte
said
mr
sowerberry
who
had
followed
oliver
down
give
this
boy
some
of
the
cold
bits
that
were
put
by
for
trip
he
hasn
t
come
home
since
the
morning
so
he
may
go
without
em
i
dare
say
the
boy
isn
t
too
dainty
to
eat
em
are
you
boy
oliver
whose
eyes
had
glistened
at
the
mention
of
meat
and
who
was
trembling
with
eagerness
to
devour
it
replied
in
the
negative
and
a
plateful
of
coarse
broken
victuals
was
set
before
him
i
wish
some
well
fed
philosopher
whose
meat
and
drink
turn
to
gall
within
him
whose
blood
is
ice
whose
heart
is
iron
could
have
seen
oliver
twist
clutching
at
the
dainty
viands
that
the
dog
had
neglected
i
wish
he
could
have
witnessed
the
horrible
avidity
with
which
oliver
tore
the
bits
asunder
with
all
the
ferocity
of
famine
there
is
only
one
thing
i
should
like
better
and
that
would
be
to
see
the
philosopher
making
the
same
sort
of
meal
himself
with
the
same
relish
well
said
the
undertaker
s
wife
when
oliver
had
finished
his
supper
which
she
had
regarded
in
silent
horror
and
with
fearful
auguries
of
his
future
appetite
have
you
done
there
being
nothing
eatable
within
his
reach
oliver
replied
in
the
affirmative
then
come
with
me
said
mrs
sowerberry
taking
up
a
dim
and
dirty
lamp
and
leading
the
way
upstairs
your
bed
s
under
the
counter
you
don
t
mind
sleeping
among
the
coffins
i
suppose
but
it
doesn
t
much
matter
whether
you
do
or
don
t
for
you
can
t
sleep
anywhere
else
come
don
t
keep
me
here
all
night
oliver
lingered
no
longer
but
meekly
followed
his
new
mistress
chapter
v
oliver
mingles
with
new
associates
going
to
a
funeral
for
the
first
time
he
forms
an
unfavourable
notion
of
his
master
s
business
oliver
being
left
to
himself
in
the
undertaker
s
shop
set
the
lamp
down
on
a
workman
s
bench
and
gazed
timidly
about
him
with
a
feeling
of
awe
and
dread
which
many
people
a
good
deal
older
than
he
will
be
at
no
loss
to
understand
an
unfinished
coffin
on
black
tressels
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
shop
looked
so
gloomy
and
death
like
that
a
cold
tremble
came
over
him
every
time
his
eyes
wandered
in
the
direction
of
the
dismal
object
from
which
he
almost
expected
to
see
some
frightful
form
slowly
rear
its
head
to
drive
him
mad
with
terror
against
the
wall
were
ranged
in
regular
array
a
long
row
of
elm
boards
cut
in
the
same
shape
looking
in
the
dim
light
like
high
shouldered
ghosts
with
their
hands
in
their
breeches
pockets
coffin
plates
elm
chips
bright
headed
nails
and
shreds
of
black
cloth
lay
scattered
on
the
floor
and
the
wall
behind
the
counter
was
ornamented
with
a
lively
representation
of
two
mutes
in
very
stiff
neckcloths
on
duty
at
a
large
private
door
with
a
hearse
drawn
by
four
black
steeds
approaching
in
the
distance
the
shop
was
close
and
hot
the
atmosphere
seemed
tainted
with
the
smell
of
coffins
the
recess
beneath
the
counter
in
which
his
flock
mattress
was
thrust
looked
like
a
grave
nor
were
these
the
only
dismal
feelings
which
depressed
oliver
he
was
alone
in
a
strange
place
and
we
all
know
how
chilled
and
desolate
the
best
of
us
will
sometimes
feel
in
such
a
situation
the
boy
had
no
friends
to
care
for
or
to
care
for
him
the
regret
of
no
recent
separation
was
fresh
in
his
mind
the
absence
of
no
loved
and
well
remembered
face
sank
heavily
into
his
heart
but
his
heart
was
heavy
notwithstanding
and
he
wished
as
he
crept
into
his
narrow
bed
that
that
were
his
coffin
and
that
he
could
be
lain
in
a
calm
and
lasting
sleep
in
the
churchyard
ground
with
the
tall
grass
waving
gently
above
his
head
and
the
sound
of
the
old
deep
bell
to
soothe
him
in
his
sleep
oliver
was
awakened
in
the
morning
by
a
loud
kicking
at
the
outside
of
the
shop
door
which
before
he
could
huddle
on
his
clothes
was
repeated
in
an
angry
and
impetuous
manner
about
twenty
five
times
when
he
began
to
undo
the
chain
the
legs
desisted
and
a
voice
began
open
the
door
will
yer
cried
the
voice
which
belonged
to
the
legs
which
had
kicked
at
the
door
i
will
directly
sir
replied
oliver
undoing
the
chain
and
turning
the
key
i
suppose
yer
the
new
boy
ain
t
yer
said
the
voice
through
the
key
hole
yes
sir
replied
oliver
how
old
are
yer
inquired
the
voice
ten
sir
replied
oliver
then
i
ll
whop
yer
when
i
get
in
said
the
voice
you
just
see
if
i
don
t
that
s
all
my
work
us
brat
and
having
made
this
obliging
promise
the
voice
began
to
whistle
oliver
had
been
too
often
subjected
to
the
process
to
which
the
very
expressive
monosyllable
just
recorded
bears
reference
to
entertain
the
smallest
doubt
that
the
owner
of
the
voice
whoever
he
might
be
would
redeem
his
pledge
most
honourably
he
drew
back
the
bolts
with
a
trembling
hand
and
opened
the
door
for
a
second
or
two
oliver
glanced
up
the
street
and
down
the
street
and
over
the
way
impressed
with
the
belief
that
the
unknown
who
had
addressed
him
through
the
key
hole
had
walked
a
few
paces
off
to
warm
himself
for
nobody
did
he
see
but
a
big
charity
boy
sitting
on
a
post
in
front
of
the
house
eating
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
which
he
cut
into
wedges
the
size
of
his
mouth
with
a
clasp
knife
and
then
consumed
with
great
dexterity
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
said
oliver
at
length
seeing
that
no
other
visitor
made
his
appearance
did
you
knock
i
kicked
replied
the
charity
boy
did
you
want
a
coffin
sir
inquired
oliver
innocently
at
this
the
charity
boy
looked
monstrous
fierce
and
said
that
oliver
would
want
one
before
long
if
he
cut
jokes
with
his
superiors
in
that
way
yer
don
t
know
who
i
am
i
suppose
work
us
said
the
charity
boy
in
continuation
descending
from
the
top
of
the
post
meanwhile
with
edifying
gravity
no
sir
rejoined
oliver
i
m
mister
noah
claypole
said
the
charity
boy
and
you
re
under
me
take
down
the
shutters
yer
idle
young
ruffian
with
this
mr
claypole
administered
a
kick
to
oliver
and
entered
the
shop
with
a
dignified
air
which
did
him
great
credit
it
is
difficult
for
a
large
headed
small
eyed
youth
of
lumbering
make
and
heavy
countenance
to
look
dignified
under
any
circumstances
but
it
is
more
especially
so
when
superadded
to
these
personal
attractions
are
a
red
nose
and
yellow
smalls
oliver
having
taken
down
the
shutters
and
broken
a
pane
of
glass
in
his
effort
to
stagger
away
beneath
the
weight
of
the
first
one
to
a
small
court
at
the
side
of
the
house
in
which
they
were
kept
during
the
day
was
graciously
assisted
by
noah
who
having
consoled
him
with
the
assurance
that
he
d
catch
it
condescended
to
help
him
mr
sowerberry
came
down
soon
after
shortly
afterwards
mrs
sowerberry
appeared
oliver
having
caught
it
in
fulfilment
of
noah
s
prediction
followed
that
young
gentleman
down
the
stairs
to
breakfast
come
near
the
fire
noah
said
charlotte
i
saved
a
nice
little
bit
of
bacon
for
you
from
master
s
breakfast
oliver
shut
that
door
at
mister
noah
s
back
and
take
them
bits
that
i
ve
put
out
on
the
cover
of
the
bread
pan
there
s
your
tea
take
it
away
to
that
box
and
drink
it
there
and
make
haste
for
they
ll
want
you
to
mind
the
shop
d
ye
hear
d
ye
hear
work
us
said
noah
claypole
lor
noah
said
charlotte
what
a
rum
creature
you
are
why
don
t
you
let
the
boy
alone
let
him
alone
said
noah
why
everybody
lets
him
alone
enough
for
the
matter
of
that
neither
his
father
nor
his
mother
will
ever
interfere
with
him
all
his
relations
let
him
have
his
own
way
pretty
well
eh
charlotte
he
he
he
oh
you
queer
soul
said
charlotte
bursting
into
a
hearty
laugh
in
which
she
was
joined
by
noah
after
which
they
both
looked
scornfully
at
poor
oliver
twist
as
he
sat
shivering
on
the
box
in
the
coldest
corner
of
the
room
and
ate
the
stale
pieces
which
had
been
specially
reserved
for
him
noah
was
a
charity
boy
but
not
a
workhouse
orphan
no
chance
child
was
he
for
he
could
trace
his
genealogy
all
the
way
back
to
his
parents
who
lived
hard
by
his
mother
being
a
washerwoman
and
his
father
a
drunken
soldier
discharged
with
a
wooden
leg
and
a
diurnal
pension
of
twopence
halfpenny
and
an
unstateable
fraction
the
shop
boys
in
the
neighbourhood
had
long
been
in
the
habit
of
branding
noah
in
the
public
streets
with
the
ignominious
epithets
of
leathers
charity
and
the
like
and
noah
had
borne
them
without
reply
but
now
that
fortune
had
cast
in
his
way
a
nameless
orphan
at
whom
even
the
meanest
could
point
the
finger
of
scorn
he
retorted
on
him
with
interest
this
affords
charming
food
for
contemplation
it
shows
us
what
a
beautiful
thing
human
nature
may
be
made
to
be
and
how
impartially
the
same
amiable
qualities
are
developed
in
the
finest
lord
and
the
dirtiest
charity
boy
oliver
had
been
sojourning
at
the
undertaker
s
some
three
weeks
or
a
month
mr
and
mrs
sowerberry
the
shop
being
shut
up
were
taking
their
supper
in
the
little
back
parlour
when
mr
sowerberry
after
several
deferential
glances
at
his
wife
said
my
dear
he
was
going
to
say
more
but
mrs
sowerberry
looking
up
with
a
peculiarly
unpropitious
aspect
he
stopped
short
well
said
mrs
sowerberry
sharply
nothing
my
dear
nothing
said
mr
sowerberry
ugh
you
brute
said
mrs
sowerberry
not
at
all
my
dear
said
mr
sowerberry
humbly
i
thought
you
didn
t
want
to
hear
my
dear
i
was
only
going
to
say
oh
don
t
tell
me
what
you
were
going
to
say
interposed
mrs
sowerberry
i
am
nobody
don
t
consult
me
pray
i
don
t
want
to
intrude
upon
your
secrets
as
mrs
sowerberry
said
this
she
gave
an
hysterical
laugh
which
threatened
violent
consequences
but
my
dear
said
sowerberry
i
want
to
ask
your
advice
no
no
don
t
ask
mine
replied
mrs
sowerberry
in
an
affecting
manner
ask
somebody
else
s
here
there
was
another
hysterical
laugh
which
frightened
mr
sowerberry
very
much
this
is
a
very
common
and
much
approved
matrimonial
course
of
treatment
which
is
often
very
effective
it
at
once
reduced
mr
sowerberry
to
begging
as
a
special
favour
to
be
allowed
to
say
what
mrs
sowerberry
was
most
curious
to
hear
after
a
short
duration
the
permission
was
most
graciously
conceded
it
s
only
about
young
twist
my
dear
said
mr
sowerberry
a
very
good
looking
boy
that
my
dear
he
need
be
for
he
eats
enough
observed
the
lady
there
s
an
expression
of
melancholy
in
his
face
my
dear
resumed
mr
sowerberry
which
is
very
interesting
he
would
make
a
delightful
mute
my
love
mrs
sowerberry
looked
up
with
an
expression
of
considerable
wonderment
mr
sowerberry
remarked
it
and
without
allowing
time
for
any
observation
on
the
good
lady
s
part
proceeded
i
don
t
mean
a
regular
mute
to
attend
grown
up
people
my
dear
but
only
for
children
s
practice
it
would
be
very
new
to
have
a
mute
in
proportion
my
dear
you
may
depend
upon
it
it
would
have
a
superb
effect
mrs
sowerberry
who
had
a
good
deal
of
taste
in
the
undertaking
way
was
much
struck
by
the
novelty
of
this
idea
but
as
it
would
have
been
compromising
her
dignity
to
have
said
so
under
existing
circumstances
she
merely
inquired
with
much
sharpness
why
such
an
obvious
suggestion
had
not
presented
itself
to
her
husband
s
mind
before
mr
sowerberry
rightly
construed
this
as
an
acquiescence
in
his
proposition
it
was
speedily
determined
therefore
that
oliver
should
be
at
once
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
the
trade
and
with
this
view
that
he
should
accompany
his
master
on
the
very
next
occasion
of
his
services
being
required
the
occasion
was
not
long
in
coming
half
an
hour
after
breakfast
next
morning
mr
bumble
entered
the
shop
and
supporting
his
cane
against
the
counter
drew
forth
his
large
leathern
pocket
book
from
which
he
selected
a
small
scrap
of
paper
which
he
handed
over
to
sowerberry
aha
said
the
undertaker
glancing
over
it
with
a
lively
countenance
an
order
for
a
coffin
eh
for
a
coffin
first
and
a
porochial
funeral
afterwards
replied
mr
bumble
fastening
the
strap
of
the
leathern
pocket
book
which
like
himself
was
very
corpulent
bayton
said
the
undertaker
looking
from
the
scrap
of
paper
to
mr
bumble
i
never
heard
the
name
before
bumble
shook
his
head
as
he
replied
obstinate
people
mr
sowerberry
very
obstinate
proud
too
i
m
afraid
sir
proud
eh
exclaimed
mr
sowerberry
with
a
sneer
come
that
s
too
much
oh
it
s
sickening
replied
the
beadle
antimonial
mr
sowerberry
so
it
is
acquiesced
the
undertaker
we
only
heard
of
the
family
the
night
before
last
said
the
beadle
and
we
shouldn
t
have
known
anything
about
them
then
only
a
woman
who
lodges
in
the
same
house
made
an
application
to
the
porochial
committee
for
them
to
send
the
porochial
surgeon
to
see
a
woman
as
was
very
bad
he
had
gone
out
to
dinner
but
his
prentice
which
is
a
very
clever
lad
sent
em
some
medicine
in
a
blacking
bottle
offhand
ah
there
s
promptness
said
the
undertaker
promptness
indeed
replied
the
beadle
but
what
s
the
consequence
what
s
the
ungrateful
behaviour
of
these
rebels
sir
why
the
husband
sends
back
word
that
the
medicine
won
t
suit
his
wife
s
complaint
and
so
she
shan
t
take
it
says
she
shan
t
take
it
sir
good
strong
wholesome
medicine
as
was
given
with
great
success
to
two
irish
labourers
and
a
coal
heaver
only
a
week
before
sent
em
for
nothing
with
a
blackin
bottle
in
and
he
sends
back
word
that
she
shan
t
take
it
sir
as
the
atrocity
presented
itself
to
mr
bumble
s
mind
in
full
force
he
struck
the
counter
sharply
with
his
cane
and
became
flushed
with
indignation
well
said
the
undertaker
i
ne
ver
did
never
did
sir
ejaculated
the
beadle
no
nor
nobody
never
did
but
now
she
s
dead
we
ve
got
to
bury
her
and
that
s
the
direction
and
the
sooner
it
s
done
the
better
thus
saying
mr
bumble
put
on
his
cocked
hat
wrong
side
first
in
a
fever
of
parochial
excitement
and
flounced
out
of
the
shop
why
he
was
so
angry
oliver
that
he
forgot
even
to
ask
after
you
said
mr
sowerberry
looking
after
the
beadle
as
he
strode
down
the
street
yes
sir
replied
oliver
who
had
carefully
kept
himself
out
of
sight
during
the
interview
and
who
was
shaking
from
head
to
foot
at
the
mere
recollection
of
the
sound
of
mr
bumble
s
voice
he
needn
t
have
taken
the
trouble
to
shrink
from
mr
bumble
s
glance
however
for
that
functionary
on
whom
the
prediction
of
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
had
made
a
very
strong
impression
thought
that
now
the
undertaker
had
got
oliver
upon
trial
the
subject
was
better
avoided
until
such
time
as
he
should
be
firmly
bound
for
seven
years
and
all
danger
of
his
being
returned
upon
the
hands
of
the
parish
should
be
thus
effectually
and
legally
overcome
well
said
mr
sowerberry
taking
up
his
hat
the
sooner
this
job
is
done
the
better
noah
look
after
the
shop
oliver
put
on
your
cap
and
come
with
me
oliver
obeyed
and
followed
his
master
on
his
professional
mission
they
walked
on
for
some
time
through
the
most
crowded
and
densely
inhabited
part
of
the
town
and
then
striking
down
a
narrow
street
more
dirty
and
miserable
than
any
they
had
yet
passed
through
paused
to
look
for
the
house
which
was
the
object
of
their
search
the
houses
on
either
side
were
high
and
large
but
very
old
and
tenanted
by
people
of
the
poorest
class
as
their
neglected
appearance
would
have
sufficiently
denoted
without
the
concurrent
testimony
afforded
by
the
squalid
looks
of
the
few
men
and
women
who
with
folded
arms
and
bodies
half
doubled
occasionally
skulked
along
a
great
many
of
the
tenements
had
shop
fronts
but
these
were
fast
closed
and
mouldering
away
only
the
upper
rooms
being
inhabited
some
houses
which
had
become
insecure
from
age
and
decay
were
prevented
from
falling
into
the
street
by
huge
beams
of
wood
reared
against
the
walls
and
firmly
planted
in
the
road
but
even
these
crazy
dens
seemed
to
have
been
selected
as
the
nightly
haunts
of
some
houseless
wretches
for
many
of
the
rough
boards
which
supplied
the
place
of
door
and
window
were
wrenched
from
their
positions
to
afford
an
aperture
wide
enough
for
the
passage
of
a
human
body
the
kennel
was
stagnant
and
filthy
the
very
rats
which
here
and
there
lay
putrefying
in
its
rottenness
were
hideous
with
famine
there
was
neither
knocker
nor
bell
handle
at
the
open
door
where
oliver
and
his
master
stopped
so
groping
his
way
cautiously
through
the
dark
passage
and
bidding
oliver
keep
close
to
him
and
not
be
afraid
the
undertaker
mounted
to
the
top
of
the
first
flight
of
stairs
stumbling
against
a
door
on
the
landing
he
rapped
at
it
with
his
knuckles
it
was
opened
by
a
young
girl
of
thirteen
or
fourteen
the
undertaker
at
once
saw
enough
of
what
the
room
contained
to
know
it
was
the
apartment
to
which
he
had
been
directed
he
stepped
in
oliver
followed
him
there
was
no
fire
in
the
room
but
a
man
was
crouching
mechanically
over
the
empty
stove
an
old
woman
too
had
drawn
a
low
stool
to
the
cold
hearth
and
was
sitting
beside
him
there
were
some
ragged
children
in
another
corner
and
in
a
small
recess
opposite
the
door
there
lay
upon
the
ground
something
covered
with
an
old
blanket
oliver
shuddered
as
he
cast
his
eyes
toward
the
place
and
crept
involuntarily
closer
to
his
master
for
though
it
was
covered
up
the
boy
felt
that
it
was
a
corpse
the
man
s
face
was
thin
and
very
pale
his
hair
and
beard
were
grizzly
his
eyes
were
bloodshot
the
old
woman
s
face
was
wrinkled
her
two
remaining
teeth
protruded
over
her
under
lip
and
her
eyes
were
bright
and
piercing
oliver
was
afraid
to
look
at
either
her
or
the
man
they
seemed
so
like
the
rats
he
had
seen
outside
nobody
shall
go
near
her
said
the
man
starting
fiercely
up
as
the
undertaker
approached
the
recess
keep
back
damn
you
keep
back
if
you
ve
a
life
to
lose
nonsense
my
good
man
said
the
undertaker
who
was
pretty
well
used
to
misery
in
all
its
shapes
nonsense
i
tell
you
said
the
man
clenching
his
hands
and
stamping
furiously
on
the
floor
i
tell
you
i
won
t
have
her
put
into
the
ground
she
couldn
t
rest
there
the
worms
would
worry
her
not
eat
her
she
is
so
worn
away
the
undertaker
offered
no
reply
to
this
raving
but
producing
a
tape
from
his
pocket
knelt
down
for
a
moment
by
the
side
of
the
body
ah
said
the
man
bursting
into
tears
and
sinking
on
his
knees
at
the
feet
of
the
dead
woman
kneel
down
kneel
down
kneel
round
her
every
one
of
you
and
mark
my
words
i
say
she
was
starved
to
death
i
never
knew
how
bad
she
was
till
the
fever
came
upon
her
and
then
her
bones
were
starting
through
the
skin
there
was
neither
fire
nor
candle
she
died
in
the
dark
in
the
dark
she
couldn
t
even
see
her
children
s
faces
though
we
heard
her
gasping
out
their
names
i
begged
for
her
in
the
streets
and
they
sent
me
to
prison
when
i
came
back
she
was
dying
and
all
the
blood
in
my
heart
has
dried
up
for
they
starved
her
to
death
i
swear
it
before
the
god
that
saw
it
they
starved
her
he
twined
his
hands
in
his
hair
and
with
a
loud
scream
rolled
grovelling
upon
the
floor
his
eyes
fixed
and
the
foam
covering
his
lips
the
terrified
children
cried
bitterly
but
the
old
woman
who
had
hitherto
remained
as
quiet
as
if
she
had
been
wholly
deaf
to
all
that
passed
menaced
them
into
silence
having
unloosened
the
cravat
of
the
man
who
still
remained
extended
on
the
ground
she
tottered
towards
the
undertaker
she
was
my
daughter
said
the
old
woman
nodding
her
head
in
the
direction
of
the
corpse
and
speaking
with
an
idiotic
leer
more
ghastly
than
even
the
presence
of
death
in
such
a
place
lord
lord
well
it
is
strange
that
i
who
gave
birth
to
her
and
was
a
woman
then
should
be
alive
and
merry
now
and
she
lying
there
so
cold
and
stiff
lord
lord
to
think
of
it
it
s
as
good
as
a
play
as
good
as
a
play
as
the
wretched
creature
mumbled
and
chuckled
in
her
hideous
merriment
the
undertaker
turned
to
go
away
stop
stop
said
the
old
woman
in
a
loud
whisper
will
she
be
buried
tomorrow
or
next
day
or
tonight
i
laid
her
out
and
i
must
walk
you
know
send
me
a
large
cloak
a
good
warm
one
for
it
is
bitter
cold
we
should
have
cake
and
wine
too
before
we
go
never
mind
send
some
bread
only
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
cup
of
water
shall
we
have
some
bread
dear
she
said
eagerly
catching
at
the
undertaker
s
coat
as
he
once
more
moved
towards
the
door
yes
yes
said
the
undertaker
of
course
anything
you
like
he
disengaged
himself
from
the
old
woman
s
grasp
and
drawing
oliver
after
him
hurried
away
the
next
day
the
family
having
been
meanwhile
relieved
with
a
half
quartern
loaf
and
a
piece
of
cheese
left
with
them
by
mr
bumble
himself
oliver
and
his
master
returned
to
the
miserable
abode
where
mr
bumble
had
already
arrived
accompanied
by
four
men
from
the
workhouse
who
were
to
act
as
bearers
an
old
black
cloak
had
been
thrown
over
the
rags
of
the
old
woman
and
the
man
and
the
bare
coffin
having
been
screwed
down
was
hoisted
on
the
shoulders
of
the
bearers
and
carried
into
the
street
now
you
must
put
your
best
leg
foremost
old
lady
whispered
sowerberry
in
the
old
woman
s
ear
we
are
rather
late
and
it
won
t
do
to
keep
the
clergyman
waiting
move
on
my
men
as
quick
as
you
like
thus
directed
the
bearers
trotted
on
under
their
light
burden
and
the
two
mourners
kept
as
near
them
as
they
could
mr
bumble
and
sowerberry
walked
at
a
good
smart
pace
in
front
and
oliver
whose
legs
were
not
so
long
as
his
master
s
ran
by
the
side
there
was
not
so
great
a
necessity
for
hurrying
as
mr
sowerberry
had
anticipated
however
for
when
they
reached
the
obscure
corner
of
the
churchyard
in
which
the
nettles
grew
and
where
the
parish
graves
were
made
the
clergyman
had
not
arrived
and
the
clerk
who
was
sitting
by
the
vestry
room
fire
seemed
to
think
it
by
no
means
improbable
that
it
might
be
an
hour
or
so
before
he
came
so
they
put
the
bier
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
and
the
two
mourners
waited
patiently
in
the
damp
clay
with
a
cold
rain
drizzling
down
while
the
ragged
boys
whom
the
spectacle
had
attracted
into
the
churchyard
played
a
noisy
game
at
hide
and
seek
among
the
tombstones
or
varied
their
amusements
by
jumping
backwards
and
forwards
over
the
coffin
mr
sowerberry
and
bumble
being
personal
friends
of
the
clerk
sat
by
the
fire
with
him
and
read
the
paper
at
length
after
a
lapse
of
something
more
than
an
hour
mr
bumble
and
sowerberry
and
the
clerk
were
seen
running
towards
the
grave
immediately
afterwards
the
clergyman
appeared
putting
on
his
surplice
as
he
came
along
mr
bumble
then
thrashed
a
boy
or
two
to
keep
up
appearances
and
the
reverend
gentleman
having
read
as
much
of
the
burial
service
as
could
be
compressed
into
four
minutes
gave
his
surplice
to
the
clerk
and
walked
away
again
now
bill
said
sowerberry
to
the
grave
digger
fill
up
it
was
no
very
difficult
task
for
the
grave
was
so
full
that
the
uppermost
coffin
was
within
a
few
feet
of
the
surface
the
grave
digger
shovelled
in
the
earth
stamped
it
loosely
down
with
his
feet
shouldered
his
spade
and
walked
off
followed
by
the
boys
who
murmured
very
loud
complaints
at
the
fun
being
over
so
soon
come
my
good
fellow
said
bumble
tapping
the
man
on
the
back
they
want
to
shut
up
the
yard
the
man
who
had
never
once
moved
since
he
had
taken
his
station
by
the
grave
side
started
raised
his
head
stared
at
the
person
who
had
addressed
him
walked
forward
for
a
few
paces
and
fell
down
in
a
swoon
the
crazy
old
woman
was
too
much
occupied
in
bewailing
the
loss
of
her
cloak
which
the
undertaker
had
taken
off
to
pay
him
any
attention
so
they
threw
a
can
of
cold
water
over
him
and
when
he
came
to
saw
him
safely
out
of
the
churchyard
locked
the
gate
and
departed
on
their
different
ways
well
oliver
said
sowerberry
as
they
walked
home
how
do
you
like
it
pretty
well
thank
you
sir
replied
oliver
with
considerable
hesitation
not
very
much
sir
ah
you
ll
get
used
to
it
in
time
oliver
said
sowerberry
nothing
when
you
are
used
to
it
my
boy
oliver
wondered
in
his
own
mind
whether
it
had
taken
a
very
long
time
to
get
mr
sowerberry
used
to
it
but
he
thought
it
better
not
to
ask
the
question
and
walked
back
to
the
shop
thinking
over
all
he
had
seen
and
heard
chapter
vi
oliver
being
goaded
by
the
taunts
of
noah
rouses
into
action
and
rather
astonishes
him
the
month
s
trial
over
oliver
was
formally
apprenticed
it
was
a
nice
sickly
season
just
at
this
time
in
commercial
phrase
coffins
were
looking
up
and
in
the
course
of
a
few
weeks
oliver
acquired
a
great
deal
of
experience
the
success
of
mr
sowerberry
s
ingenious
speculation
exceeded
even
his
most
sanguine
hopes
the
oldest
inhabitants
recollected
no
period
at
which
measles
had
been
so
prevalent
or
so
fatal
to
infant
existence
and
many
were
the
mournful
processions
which
little
oliver
headed
in
a
hat
band
reaching
down
to
his
knees
to
the
indescribable
admiration
and
emotion
of
all
the
mothers
in
the
town
as
oliver
accompanied
his
master
in
most
of
his
adult
expeditions
too
in
order
that
he
might
acquire
that
equanimity
of
demeanour
and
full
command
of
nerve
which
was
essential
to
a
finished
undertaker
he
had
many
opportunities
of
observing
the
beautiful
resignation
and
fortitude
with
which
some
strong
minded
people
bear
their
trials
and
losses
for
instance
when
sowerberry
had
an
order
for
the
burial
of
some
rich
old
lady
or
gentleman
who
was
surrounded
by
a
great
number
of
nephews
and
nieces
who
had
been
perfectly
inconsolable
during
the
previous
illness
and
whose
grief
had
been
wholly
irrepressible
even
on
the
most
public
occasions
they
would
be
as
happy
among
themselves
as
need
be
quite
cheerful
and
contented
conversing
together
with
as
much
freedom
and
gaiety
as
if
nothing
whatever
had
happened
to
disturb
them
husbands
too
bore
the
loss
of
their
wives
with
the
most
heroic
calmness
wives
again
put
on
weeds
for
their
husbands
as
if
so
far
from
grieving
in
the
garb
of
sorrow
they
had
made
up
their
minds
to
render
it
as
becoming
and
attractive
as
possible
it
was
observable
too
that
ladies
and
gentlemen
who
were
in
passions
of
anguish
during
the
ceremony
of
interment
recovered
almost
as
soon
as
they
reached
home
and
became
quite
composed
before
the
tea
drinking
was
over
all
this
was
very
pleasant
and
improving
to
see
and
oliver
beheld
it
with
great
admiration
that
oliver
twist
was
moved
to
resignation
by
the
example
of
these
good
people
i
cannot
although
i
am
his
biographer
undertake
to
affirm
with
any
degree
of
confidence
but
i
can
most
distinctly
say
that
for
many
months
he
continued
meekly
to
submit
to
the
domination
and
ill
treatment
of
noah
claypole
who
used
him
far
worse
than
before
now
that
his
jealousy
was
roused
by
seeing
the
new
boy
promoted
to
the
black
stick
and
hat
band
while
he
the
old
one
remained
stationary
in
the
muffin
cap
and
leathers
charlotte
treated
him
ill
because
noah
did
and
mrs
sowerberry
was
his
decided
enemy
because
mr
sowerberry
was
disposed
to
be
his
friend
so
between
these
three
on
one
side
and
a
glut
of
funerals
on
the
other
oliver
was
not
altogether
as
comfortable
as
the
hungry
pig
was
when
he
was
shut
up
by
mistake
in
the
grain
department
of
a
brewery
and
now
i
come
to
a
very
important
passage
in
oliver
s
history
for
i
have
to
record
an
act
slight
and
unimportant
perhaps
in
appearance
but
which
indirectly
produced
a
material
change
in
all
his
future
prospects
and
proceedings
one
day
oliver
and
noah
had
descended
into
the
kitchen
at
the
usual
dinner
hour
to
banquet
upon
a
small
joint
of
mutton
a
pound
and
a
half
of
the
worst
end
of
the
neck
when
charlotte
being
called
out
of
the
way
there
ensued
a
brief
interval
of
time
which
noah
claypole
being
hungry
and
vicious
considered
he
could
not
possibly
devote
to
a
worthier
purpose
than
aggravating
and
tantalising
young
oliver
twist
intent
upon
this
innocent
amusement
noah
put
his
feet
on
the
table
cloth
and
pulled
oliver
s
hair
and
twitched
his
ears
and
expressed
his
opinion
that
he
was
a
sneak
and
furthermore
announced
his
intention
of
coming
to
see
him
hanged
whenever
that
desirable
event
should
take
place
and
entered
upon
various
topics
of
petty
annoyance
like
a
malicious
and
ill
conditioned
charity
boy
as
he
was
but
making
oliver
cry
noah
attempted
to
be
more
facetious
still
and
in
his
attempt
did
what
many
sometimes
do
to
this
day
when
they
want
to
be
funny
he
got
rather
personal
work
us
said
noah
how
s
your
mother
she
s
dead
replied
oliver
don
t
you
say
anything
about
her
to
me
oliver
s
colour
rose
as
he
said
this
he
breathed
quickly
and
there
was
a
curious
working
of
the
mouth
and
nostrils
which
mr
claypole
thought
must
be
the
immediate
precursor
of
a
violent
fit
of
crying
under
this
impression
he
returned
to
the
charge
what
did
she
die
of
work
us
said
noah
of
a
broken
heart
some
of
our
old
nurses
told
me
replied
oliver
more
as
if
he
were
talking
to
himself
than
answering
noah
i
think
i
know
what
it
must
be
to
die
of
that
tol
de
rol
lol
lol
right
fol
lairy
work

said
noah
as
a
tear
rolled
down
oliver
s
cheek
what
s
set
you
a
snivelling
now

replied
oliver
sharply
there
that
s
enough
don
t
say

more
to
me
about
her

exclaimed
noah

t
be
impudent
your
mother
too
she
was
a
nice
un
she
was
oh
lor
and
here
noah
nodded
his
head
expressively
and
curled
up
as
much
of
his
small
red
nose
as
muscular
action
could
collect
together
for
the
occasion
yer
know
work
us
continued
noah
emboldened
by
oliver
s
silence
and
speaking
in
a
jeering
tone
of
affected
pity
of
all
tones
the
most
annoying
yer
know
work
us
it
can
t
be
helped
now
and
of
course
yer
couldn
t
help
it
then
and
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
and
i
m
sure

and

very
much
but
yer
must
know
work

yer
mother

a
regular
right
down
bad
un
what

you
say
inquired
oliver
looking
up
very
quickly
a
regular
right
down
bad
un
work
us
replied
noah
coolly
and
it
s
a
great
deal
better
work
us
that
she
died
when
she
did
or
else
she
d
have
been
hard
labouring
in
bridewell
or
transported
or
hung
which
is
more
likely
than
either
isn
t
it
crimson
with
fury
oliver
started
up
overthrew
the
chair
and
table
seized
noah
by
the
throat
shook
him
in
the
violence
of
his
rage
till
his
teeth
chattered
in
his
head
and
collecting
his
whole
force
into
one
heavy
blow
felled
him
to
the
ground
a
minute
ago
the
boy
had
looked
the
quiet
child
mild
dejected
creature
that
harsh
treatment
had
made
him
but
his
spirit
was
roused
at
last
the
cruel
insult
to
his
dead
mother
had
set
his
blood
on
fire
his
breast
heaved
his
attitude
was
erect
his
eye
bright
and
vivid
his
whole
person
changed
as
he
stood
glaring
over
the
cowardly
tormentor
who
now
lay
crouching
at
his
feet
and
defied
him
with
an
energy
he
had
never
known
before
he
ll
murder
me
blubbered
noah
charlotte
missis
here
s
the
new
boy
a
murdering
of
me
help
help
oliver
s
gone
mad
char
lotte
noah
s
shouts
were
responded
to
by
a
loud
scream
from
charlotte
and
a
louder
from
mrs
sowerberry
the
former
of
whom
rushed
into
the
kitchen
by
a
side
door
while
the
latter
paused
on
the
staircase
till
she
was
quite
certain
that
it
was
consistent
with
the
preservation
of
human
life
to
come
further
down
oh
you
little
wretch
screamed
charlotte
seizing
oliver
with
her
utmost
force
which
was
about
equal
to
that
of
a
moderately
strong
man
in
particularly
good
training
oh
you
little
un
grate
ful
mur
de
rous
hor
rid
villain
and
between
every
syllable
charlotte
gave
oliver
a
blow
with
all
her
might
accompanying
it
with
a
scream
for
the
benefit
of
society
charlotte
s
fist
was
by
no
means
a
light
one
but
lest
it
should
not
be
effectual
in
calming
oliver
s
wrath
mrs
sowerberry
plunged
into
the
kitchen
and
assisted
to
hold
him
with
one
hand
while
she
scratched
his
face
with
the
other
in
this
favourable
position
of
affairs
noah
rose
from
the
ground
and
pommelled
him
behind
this
was
rather
too
violent
exercise
to
last
long
when
they
were
all
wearied
out
and
could
tear
and
beat
no
longer
they
dragged
oliver
struggling
and
shouting
but
nothing
daunted
into
the
dust
cellar
and
there
locked
him
up
this
being
done
mrs
sowerberry
sunk
into
a
chair
and
burst
into
tears
bless
her
she
s
going
off
said
charlotte
a
glass
of
water
noah
dear
make
haste
oh
charlotte
said
mrs
sowerberry
speaking
as
well
as
she
could
through
a
deficiency
of
breath
and
a
sufficiency
of
cold
water
which
noah
had
poured
over
her
head
and
shoulders
oh
charlotte
what
a
mercy
we
have
not
all
been
murdered
in
our
beds
ah
mercy
indeed
ma
am
was
the
reply
i
only
hope
this
ll
teach
master
not
to
have
any
more
of
these
dreadful
creatures
that
are
born
to
be
murderers
and
robbers
from
their
very
cradle
poor
noah
he
was
all
but
killed
ma
am
when
i
came
in
poor
fellow
said
mrs
sowerberry
looking
piteously
on
the
charity
boy
noah
whose
top
waistcoat
button
might
have
been
somewhere
on
a
level
with
the
crown
of
oliver
s
head
rubbed
his
eyes
with
the
inside
of
his
wrists
while
this
commiseration
was
bestowed
upon
him
and
performed
some
affecting
tears
and
sniffs
what
s
to
be
done
exclaimed
mrs
sowerberry
your
master
s
not
at
home
there
s
not
a
man
in
the
house
and
he
ll
kick
that
door
down
in
ten
minutes
oliver
s
vigorous
plunges
against
the
bit
of
timber
in
question
rendered
this
occurance
highly
probable
dear
dear
i
don
t
know
ma
am
said
charlotte
unless
we
send
for
the
police
officers
or
the
millingtary
suggested
mr
claypole
no
no
said
mrs
sowerberry
bethinking
herself
of
oliver
s
old
friend
run
to
mr
bumble
noah
and
tell
him
to
come
here
directly
and
not
to
lose
a
minute
never
mind
your
cap
make
haste
you
can
hold
a
knife
to
that
black
eye
as
you
run
along
it
ll
keep
the
swelling
down
noah
stopped
to
make
no
reply
but
started
off
at
his
fullest
speed
and
very
much
it
astonished
the
people
who
were
out
walking
to
see
a
charity
boy
tearing
through
the
streets
pell
mell
with
no
cap
on
his
head
and
a
clasp
knife
at
his
eye
chapter
vii
oliver
continues
refractory
noah
claypole
ran
along
the
streets
at
his
swiftest
pace
and
paused
not
once
for
breath
until
he
reached
the
workhouse
gate
having
rested
here
for
a
minute
or
so
to
collect
a
good
burst
of
sobs
and
an
imposing
show
of
tears
and
terror
he
knocked
loudly
at
the
wicket
and
presented
such
a
rueful
face
to
the
aged
pauper
who
opened
it
that
even
he
who
saw
nothing
but
rueful
faces
about
him
at
the
best
of
times
started
back
in
astonishment
why
what
s
the
matter
with
the
boy
said
the
old
pauper
mr
bumble
mr
bumble
cried
noah
with
well
affected
dismay
and
in
tones
so
loud
and
agitated
that
they
not
only
caught
the
ear
of
mr
bumble
himself
who
happened
to
be
hard
by
but
alarmed
him
so
much
that
he
rushed
into
the
yard
without
his
cocked
hat
which
is
a
very
curious
and
remarkable
circumstance
as
showing
that
even
a
beadle
acted
upon
a
sudden
and
powerful
impulse
may
be
afflicted
with
a
momentary
visitation
of
loss
of
self
possession
and
forgetfulness
of
personal
dignity
oh
mr
bumble
sir
said
noah
oliver
sir
oliver
has
what
what
interposed
mr
bumble
with
a
gleam
of
pleasure
in
his
metallic
eyes
not
run
away
he
hasn
t
run
away
has
he
noah
no
sir
no
not
run
away
sir
but
he
s
turned
wicious
replied
noah
he
tried
to
murder
me
sir
and
then
he
tried
to
murder
charlotte
and
then
missis
oh
what
dreadful
pain
it
is
such
agony
please
sir
and
here
noah
writhed
and
twisted
his
body
into
an
extensive
variety
of
eel
like
positions
thereby
giving
mr
bumble
to
understand
that
from
the
violent
and
sanguinary
onset
of
oliver
twist
he
had
sustained
severe
internal
injury
and
damage
from
which
he
was
at
that
moment
suffering
the
acutest
torture
when
noah
saw
that
the
intelligence
he
communicated
perfectly
paralysed
mr
bumble
he
imparted
additional
effect
thereunto
by
bewailing
his
dreadful
wounds
ten
times
louder
than
before
and
when
he
observed
a
gentleman
in
a
white
waistcoat
crossing
the
yard
he
was
more
tragic
in
his
lamentations
than
ever
rightly
conceiving
it
highly
expedient
to
attract
the
notice
and
rouse
the
indignation
of
the
gentleman
aforesaid
the
gentleman
s
notice
was
very
soon
attracted
for
he
had
not
walked
three
paces
when
he
turned
angrily
round
and
inquired
what
that
young
cur
was
howling
for
and
why
mr
bumble
did
not
favour
him
with
something
which
would
render
the
series
of
vocular
exclamations
so
designated
an
involuntary
process
it
s
a
poor
boy
from
the
free
school
sir
replied
mr
bumble
who
has
been
nearly
murdered
all
but
murdered
sir
by
young
twist
by
jove
exclaimed
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
stopping
short
i
knew
it
i
felt
a
strange
presentiment
from
the
very
first
that
that
audacious
young
savage
would
come
to
be
hung
he
has
likewise
attempted
sir
to
murder
the
female
servant
said
mr
bumble
with
a
face
of
ashy
paleness
and
his
missis
interposed
mr
claypole
and
his
master
too
i
think
you
said
noah
added
mr
bumble
no
he
s
out
or
he
would
have
murdered
him
replied
noah
he
said
he
wanted
to
ah
said
he
wanted
to
did
he
my
boy
inquired
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
yes
sir
replied
noah
and
please
sir
missis
wants
to
know
whether
mr
bumble
can
spare
time
to
step
up
there
directly
and
flog
him
cause
master
s
out
certainly
my
boy
certainly
said
the
gentleman
in
the
white
waistcoat
smiling
benignly
and
patting
noah
s
head
which
was
about
three
inches
higher
than
his
own
you
re
a
good
boy
a
very
good
boy
here
s
a
penny
for
you
bumble
just
step
up
to
sowerberry
s
with
your
cane
and
see
what
s
best
to
be
done
don
t
spare
him
bumble
no
i
will
not
sir
replied
the
beadle
and
the
cocked
hat
and
cane
having
been
by
this
time
adjusted
to
their
owner
s
satisfaction
mr
bumble
and
noah
claypole
betook
themselves
with
all
speed
to
the
undertaker
s
shop
here
the
position
of
affairs
had
not
at
all
improved
sowerberry
had
not
yet
returned
and
oliver
continued
to
kick
with
undiminished
vigour
at
the
cellar
door
the
accounts
of
his
ferocity
as
related
by
mrs
sowerberry
and
charlotte
were
of
so
startling
a
nature
that
mr
bumble
judged
it
prudent
to
parley
before
opening
the
door
with
this
view
he
gave
a
kick
at
the
outside
by
way
of
prelude
and
then
applying
his
mouth
to
the
keyhole
said
in
a
deep
and
impressive
tone
oliver
come
you
let
me
out
replied
oliver
from
the
inside
do
you
know
this
here
voice
oliver
said
mr
bumble
yes
replied
oliver
ain
t
you
afraid
of
it
sir
ain
t
you
a
trembling
while
i
speak
sir
said
mr
bumble
no
replied
oliver
boldly
an
answer
so
different
from
the
one
he
had
expected
to
elicit
and
was
in
the
habit
of
receiving
staggered
mr
bumble
not
a
little
he
stepped
back
from
the
keyhole
drew
himself
up
to
his
full
height
and
looked
from
one
to
another
of
the
three
by
standers
in
mute
astonishment
oh
you
know
mr
bumble
he
must
be
mad
said
mrs
sowerberry
no
boy
in
half
his
senses
could
venture
to
speak
so
to
you
it
s
not
madness
ma
am
replied
mr
bumble
after
a
few
moments
of
deep
meditation
it
s
meat
what
exclaimed
mrs
sowerberry
meat
ma
am
meat
replied
bumble
with
stern
emphasis
you
ve
overfed
him
ma
am
you
ve
raised
a
artificial
soul
and
spirit
in
him
ma
am
unbecoming
a
person
of
his
condition
as
the
board
mrs
sowerberry
who
are
practical
philosophers
will
tell
you
what
have
paupers
to
do
with
soul
or
spirit
it
s
quite
enough
that
we
let
em
have
live
bodies
if
you
had
kept
the
boy
on
gruel
ma
am
this
would
never
have
happened
dear
dear
ejaculated
mrs
sowerberry
piously
raising
her
eyes
to
the
kitchen
ceiling
this
comes
of
being
liberal
the
liberality
of
mrs
sowerberry
to
oliver
had
consisted
of
a
profuse
bestowal
upon
him
of
all
the
dirty
odds
and
ends
which
nobody
else
would
eat
so
there
was
a
great
deal
of
meekness
and
self
devotion
in
her
voluntarily
remaining
under
mr
bumble
s
heavy
accusation
of
which
to
do
her
justice
she
was
wholly
innocent
in
thought
word
or
deed
ah
said
mr

when
the
lady
brought
her
eyes
down
to
earth
again
the
only
thing
that
can
be
done
now
that
i
know
of
is
to
leave
him
in
the
cellar
for
a
day
or
so
till
he
s
a
little
starved
down
and
then
to
take
him
out
and
keep
him
on
gruel
all
through
the
apprenticeship
he
comes
of
a
bad
family
excitable
natures
mrs
sowerberry
both
the
nurse
and
doctor
said
that
that
mother
of
his
made
her
way
here
against
difficulties
and
pain
that
would
have
killed
any
well
disposed
woman
weeks
before
at
this
point
of
mr
bumble
s
discourse
oliver
just
hearing
enough
to
know
that
some
allusion
was
being
made
to
his
mother
recommenced
kicking
with
a
violence
that
rendered
every
other
sound
inaudible
sowerberry
returned
at
this
juncture
oliver
s
offence
having
been
explained
to
him
with
such
exaggerations
as
the
ladies
thought
best
calculated
to
rouse
his
ire
he
unlocked
the
cellar
door
in
a
twinkling
and
dragged
his
rebellious
apprentice
out
by
the
collar
oliver
s
clothes
had
been
torn
in
the
beating
he
had
received
his
face
was
bruised
and
scratched
and
his
hair
scattered
over
his
forehead
the
angry
flush
had
not
disappeared
however
and
when
he
was
pulled
out
of
his
prison
he
scowled
boldly
on
noah
and
looked
quite
undismayed
now
you
are
a
nice
young
fellow
ain
t
you
said
sowerberry
giving
oliver
a
shake
and
a
box
on
the
ear
he
called
my
mother
names
replied
oliver
well
and
what
if
he
did
you
little
ungrateful
wretch
said
mrs
sowerberry
she
deserved
what
he
said
and
worse
she
didn
t
said
oliver
she
did
said
mrs
sowerberry
it
s
a
lie
said
oliver
mrs
sowerberry
burst
into
a
flood
of
tears
this
flood
of
tears
left
mr
sowerberry
no
alternative
if
he
had
hesitated
for
one
instant
to
punish
oliver
most
severely
it
must
be
quite
clear
to
every
experienced
reader
that
he
would
have
been
according
to
all
precedents
in
disputes
of
matrimony
established
a
brute
an
unnatural
husband
an
insulting
creature
a
base
imitation
of
a
man
and
various
other
agreeable
characters
too
numerous
for
recital
within
the
limits
of
this
chapter
to
do
him
justice
he
was
as
far
as
his
power
went
it
was
not
very
extensive
kindly
disposed
towards
the
boy
perhaps
because
it
was
his
interest
to
be
so
perhaps
because
his
wife
disliked
him
the
flood
of
tears
however
left
him
no
resource
so
he
at
once
gave
him
a
drubbing
which
satisfied
even
mrs
sowerberry
herself
and
rendered
mr
bumble
s
subsequent
application
of
the
parochial
cane
rather
unnecessary
for
the
rest
of
the
day
he
was
shut
up
in
the
back
kitchen
in
company
with
a
pump
and
a
slice
of
bread
and
at
night
mrs
sowerberry
after
making
various
remarks
outside
the
door
by
no
means
complimentary
to
the
memory
of
his
mother
looked
into
the
room
and
amidst
the
jeers
and
pointings
of
noah
and
charlotte
ordered
him
upstairs
to
his
dismal
bed
it
was
not
until
he
was
left
alone
in
the
silence
and
stillness
of
the
gloomy
workshop
of
the
undertaker
that
oliver
gave
way
to
the
feelings
which
the
day
s
treatment
may
be
supposed
likely
to
have
awakened
in
a
mere
child
he
had
listened
to
their
taunts
with
a
look
of
contempt
he
had
borne
the
lash
without
a
cry
for
he
felt
that
pride
swelling
in
his
heart
which
would
have
kept
down
a
shriek
to
the
last
though
they
had
roasted
him
alive
but
now
when
there
were
none
to
see
or
hear
him
he
fell
upon
his
knees
on
the
floor
and
hiding
his
face
in
his
hands
wept
such
tears
as
god
send
for
the
credit
of
our
nature
few
so
young
may
ever
have
cause
to
pour
out
before
him
for
a
long
time
oliver
remained
motionless
in
this
attitude
the
candle
was
burning
low
in
the
socket
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
having
gazed
cautiously
round
him
and
listened
intently
he
gently
undid
the
fastenings
of
the
door
and
looked
abroad
it
was
a
cold
dark
night
the
stars
seemed
to
the
boy
s
eyes
farther
from
the
earth
than
he
had
ever
seen
them
before
there
was
no
wind
and
the
sombre
shadows
thrown
by
the
trees
upon
the
ground
looked
sepulchral
and
death
like
from
being
so
still
he
softly
reclosed
the
door
having
availed
himself
of
the
expiring
light
of
the
candle
to
tie
up
in
a
handkerchief
the
few
articles
of
wearing
apparel
he
had
sat
himself
down
upon
a
bench
to
wait
for
morning
with
the
first
ray
of
light
that
struggled
through
the
crevices
in
the
shutters
oliver
arose
and
again
unbarred
the
door
one
timid
look
around
one
moment
s
pause
of
hesitation
he
had
closed
it
behind
him
and
was
in
the
open
street
he
looked
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
uncertain
whither
to
fly
he
remembered
to
have
seen
the
waggons
as
they
went
out
toiling
up
the
hill
he
took
the
same
route
and
arriving
at
a
footpath
across
the
fields
which
he
knew
after
some
distance
led
out
again
into
the
road
struck
into
it
and
walked
quickly
on
along
this
same
footpath
oliver
well
remembered
he
had
trotted
beside
mr
bumble
when
he
first
carried
him
to
the
workhouse
from
the
farm
his
way
lay
directly
in
front
of
the
cottage
his
heart
beat
quickly
when
he
bethought
himself
of
this
and
he
half
resolved
to
turn
back
he
had
come
a
long
way
though
and
should
lose
a
great
deal
of
time
by
doing
so
besides
it
was
so
early
that
there
was
very
little
fear
of
his
being
seen
so
he
walked
on
he
reached
the
house
there
was
no
appearance
of
its
inmates
stirring
at
that
early
hour
oliver
stopped
and
peeped
into
the
garden
a
child
was
weeding
one
of
the
little
beds
as
he
stopped
he
raised
his
pale
face
and
disclosed
the
features
of
one
of
his
former
companions
oliver
felt
glad
to
see
him
before
he
went
for
though
younger
than
himself
he
had
been
his
little
friend
and
playmate
they
had
been
beaten
and
starved
and
shut
up
together
many
and
many
a
time
hush
dick
said
oliver
as
the
boy
ran
to
the
gate
and
thrust
his
thin
arm
between
the
rails
to
greet
him
is
any
one
up
nobody
but
me
replied
the
child
you
musn
t
say
you
saw
me
dick
said
oliver
i
am
running
away
they
beat
and
ill
use
me
dick
and
i
am
going
to
seek
my
fortune
some
long
way
off
i
don
t
know
where
how
pale
you
are
i
heard
the
doctor
tell
them
i
was
dying
replied
the
child
with
a
faint
smile
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
dear
but
don
t
stop
don
t
stop
yes
yes

oliver

so
replied
the
child
after
i
am
dead
but
not
before
i
know
the
doctor
must
be
right
oliver
because
i
dream
so
much
of
heaven
and
angels
and
kind
faces
that
i
never
see
when
i
am
awake
kiss
me
said
the
child
climbing
up
the
low
gate
and
flinging
his
little
arms
round
oliver
s
neck
good
b
ye
dear
god
bless
you
the
blessing
was
from
a
young
child
s
lips
but
it
was
the
first
that
oliver
had
ever
heard
invoked
upon
his
head
and
through
the
struggles
and
sufferings
and
troubles
and
changes
of
his
after
life
he
never
once
forgot
it
chapter
viii
oliver
walks
to
london
he
encounters
on
the
road
a
strange
sort
of
young
gentleman
oliver
reached
the
stile
at
which
the
by
path
terminated
and
once
more
gained
the
high
road
it
was
eight
o
clock
now
though
he
was
nearly
five
miles
away
from
the
town
he
ran
and
hid
behind
the
hedges
by
turns
till
noon
fearing
that
he
might
be
pursued
and
overtaken
then
he
sat
down
to
rest
by
the
side
of
the
milestone
and
began
to
think
for
the
first
time
where
he
had
better
go
and
try
to
live
the
stone
by
which
he
was
seated
bore
in
large
characters
an
intimation
that
it
was
just
seventy
miles
from
that
spot
to
london
the
name
awakened
a
new
train
of
ideas
in
the
boy
s
mind
london
that
great
place
nobody
not
even
mr
bumble
could
ever
find
him
there
he
had
often
heard
the
old
men
in
the
workhouse
too
say
that
no
lad
of
spirit
need
want
in
london
and
that
there
were
ways
of
living
in
that
vast
city
which
those
who
had
been
bred
up
in
country
parts
had
no
idea
of
it
was
the
very
place
for
a
homeless
boy
who
must
die
in
the
streets
unless
some
one
helped
him
as
these
things
passed
through
his
thoughts
he
jumped
upon
his
feet
and
again
walked
forward
he
had
diminished
the
distance
between
himself
and
london
by
full
four
miles
more
before
he
recollected
how
much
he
must
undergo
ere
he
could
hope
to
reach
his
place
of
destination
as
this
consideration
forced
itself
upon
him
he
slackened
his
pace
a
little
and
meditated
upon
his
means
of
getting
there
he
had
a
crust
of
bread
a
coarse
shirt
and
two
pairs
of
stockings
in
his
bundle
he
had
a
penny
too
a
gift
of
sowerberry
s
after
some
funeral
in
which
he
had
acquitted
himself
more
than
ordinarily
well
in
his
pocket
a
clean
shirt
thought
oliver
is
a
very
comfortable
thing
and
so
are
two
pairs
of
darned
stockings
and
so
is
a
penny
but
they
are
small
helps
to
a
sixty
five
miles
walk
in
winter
time
but
oliver
s
thoughts
like
those
of
most
other
people
although
they
were
extremely
ready
and
active
to
point
out
his
difficulties
were
wholly
at
a
loss
to
suggest
any
feasible
mode
of
surmounting
them
so
after
a
good
deal
of
thinking
to
no
particular
purpose
he
changed
his
little
bundle
over
to
the
other
shoulder
and
trudged
on
oliver
walked
twenty
miles
that
day
and
all
that
time
tasted
nothing
but
the
crust
of
dry
bread
and
a
few
draughts
of
water
which
he
begged
at
the
cottage
doors
by
the
road
side
when
the
night
came
he
turned
into
a
meadow
and
creeping
close
under
a
hay
rick
determined
to
lie
there
till
morning
he
felt
frightened
at
first
for
the
wind
moaned
dismally
over
the
empty
fields
and
he
was
cold
and
hungry
and
more
alone
than
he
had
ever
felt
before
being
very
tired
with
his
walk
however
he
soon
fell
asleep
and
forgot
his
troubles
he
felt
cold
and
stiff
when
he
got
up
next
morning
and
so
hungry
that
he
was
obliged
to
exchange
the
penny
for
a
small
loaf
in
the
very
first
village
through
which
he
passed
he
had
walked
no
more
than
twelve
miles
when
night
closed
in
again
his
feet
were
sore
and
his
legs
so
weak
that
they
trembled
beneath
him
another
night
passed
in
the
bleak
damp
air
made
him
worse
when
he
set
forward
on
his
journey
next
morning
he
could
hardly
crawl
along
he
waited
at
the
bottom
of
a
steep
hill
till
a
stage
coach
came
up
and
then
begged
of
the
outside
passengers
but
there
were
very
few
who
took
any
notice
of
him
and
even
those
told
him
to
wait
till
they
got
to
the
top
of
the
hill
and
then
let
them
see
how
far
he
could
run
for
a
halfpenny
poor
oliver
tried
to
keep
up
with
the
coach
a
little
way
but
was
unable
to
do
it
by
reason
of
his
fatigue
and
sore
feet
when
the
outsides
saw
this
they
put
their
halfpence
back
into
their
pockets
again
declaring
that
he
was
an
idle
young
dog
and
didn
t
deserve
anything
and
the
coach
rattled
away
and
left
only
a
cloud
of
dust
behind
in
some
villages
large
painted
boards
were
fixed
up
warning
all
persons
who
begged
within
the
district
that
they
would
be
sent
to
jail
this
frightened
oliver
very
much
and
made
him
glad
to
get
out
of
those
villages
with
all
possible
expedition
in
others
he
would
stand
about
the
inn
yards
and
look
mournfully
at
every
one
who
passed
a
proceeding
which
generally
terminated
in
the
landlady
s
ordering
one
of
the
post
boys
who
were
lounging
about
to
drive
that
strange
boy
out
of
the
place
for
she
was
sure
he
had
come
to
steal
something
if
he
begged
at
a
farmer
s
house
ten
to
one
but
they
threatened
to
set
the
dog
on
him
and
when
he
showed
his
nose
in
a
shop
they
talked
about
the
beadle
which
brought
oliver
s
heart
into
his
mouth
very
often
the
only
thing
he
had
there
for
many
hours
together
in
fact
if
it
had
not
been
for
a
good
hearted
turnpike
man
and
a
benevolent
old
lady
oliver
s
troubles
would
have
been
shortened
by
the
very
same
process
which
had
put
an
end
to
his
mother
s
in
other
words
he
would
most
assuredly
have
fallen
dead
upon
the
king
s
highway
but
the
turnpike
man
gave
him
a
meal
of
bread
and
cheese
and
the
old
lady
who
had
a
shipwrecked
grandson
wandering
barefoot
in
some
distant
part
of
the
earth
took
pity
upon
the
poor
orphan
and
gave
him
what
little
she
could
afford
and
more
with
such
kind
and
gentle
words
and
such
tears
of
sympathy
and
compassion
that
they
sank
deeper
into
oliver
s
soul
than
all
the
sufferings
he
had
ever
undergone
early
on
the
seventh
morning
after
he
had
left
his
native
place
oliver
limped
slowly
into
the
little
town
of
barnet
the
window
shutters
were
closed
the
street
was
empty
not
a
soul
had
awakened
to
the
business
of
the
day
the
sun
was
rising
in
all
its
splendid
beauty
but
the
light
only
served
to
show
the
boy
his
own
lonesomeness
and
desolation
as
he
sat
with
bleeding
feet
and
covered
with
dust
upon
a
door
step
by
degrees
the
shutters
were
opened
the
window
blinds
were
drawn
up
and
people
began
passing
to
and
fro
some
few
stopped
to
gaze
at
oliver
for
a
moment
or
two
or
turned
round
to
stare
at
him
as
they
hurried
by
but
none
relieved
him
or
troubled
themselves
to
inquire
how
he
came
there
he
had
no
heart
to
beg
and
there
he
sat
he
had
been
crouching
on
the
step
for
some
time
wondering
at
the
great
number
of
public
houses
every
other
house
in
barnet
was
a
tavern
large
or
small
gazing
listlessly
at
the
coaches
as
they
passed
through
and
thinking
how
strange
it
seemed
that
they
could
do
with
ease
in
a
few
hours
what
it
had
taken
him
a
whole
week
of
courage
and
determination
beyond
his
years
to
accomplish
when
he
was
roused
by
observing
that
a
boy
who
had
passed
him
carelessly
some
minutes
before
had
returned
and
was
now
surveying
him
most
earnestly
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
he
took
little
heed
of
this
at
first
but
the
boy
remained
in
the
same
attitude
of
close
observation
so
long
that
oliver
raised
his
head
and
returned
his
steady
look
upon
this
the
boy
crossed
over
and
walking
close
up
to
oliver
said
hullo
my
covey
what
s
the
row
the
boy
who
addressed
this
inquiry
to
the
young
wayfarer
was
about
his
own
age
but
one
of
the
queerest
looking
boys
that
oliver
had
even
seen
he
was
a
snub
nosed
flat
browed
common
faced
boy
enough
and
as
dirty
a
juvenile
as
one
would
wish
to
see
but
he
had
about
him
all
the
airs
and
manners
of
a
man
he
was
short
of
his
age
with
rather
bow
legs
and
little
sharp
ugly
eyes
his
hat
was
stuck
on
the
top
of
his
head
so
lightly
that
it
threatened
to
fall
off
every
moment
and
would
have
done
so
very
often
if
the
wearer
had
not
had
a
knack
of
every
now
and
then
giving
his
head
a
sudden
twitch
which
brought
it
back
to
its
old
place
again
he
wore
a
man
s
coat
which
reached
nearly
to
his
heels
he
had
turned
the
cuffs
back
half
way
up
his
arm
to
get
his
hands
out
of
the
sleeves
apparently
with
the
ultimate
view
of
thrusting
them
into
the
pockets
of
his
corduroy
trousers
for
there
he
kept
them
he
was
altogether
as
roystering
and
swaggering
a
young
gentleman
as
ever
stood
four
feet
six
or
something
less
in
the
bluchers
hullo
my
covey
what
s
the
row
said
this
strange
young
gentleman
to
oliver
i
am
very
hungry
and
tired
replied
oliver
the
tears
standing
in
his
eyes
as
he
spoke
i
have
walked
a
long
way
i
have
been
walking
these
seven
days
walking
for
sivin
days
said
the
young
gentleman
oh
i
see
beak
s
order
eh
but
he
added
noticing
oliver
s
look
of
surprise
i
suppose
you
don
t
know
what
a
beak
is
my
flash
com
pan
i
on
oliver
mildly
replied
that
he
had
always
heard
a
bird
s
mouth
described
by
the
term
in
question
my
eyes
how
green
exclaimed
the
young
gentleman
why
a
beak
s
a
madgst
rate
and
when
you
walk
by
a
beak
s
order
it
s
not
straight
forerd
but
always
agoing
up
and
niver
a
coming
down
agin
was
you
never
on
the
mill
what
mill
inquired
oliver
what
mill
why
the
mill
the
mill
as
takes
up
so
little
room
that
it
ll
work
inside
a
stone
jug
and
always
goes
better
when
the
wind
s
low
with
people
than
when
it
s
high
acos
then
they
can
t
get
workmen
but
come
said
the
young
gentleman
you
want
grub
and
you
shall
have
it
i
m
at
low
water
mark
myself
only
one
bob
and
a
magpie
but
as
far
as
it
goes
i
ll
fork
out
and
stump
up
with
you
on
your
pins
there
now
then
morrice
assisting
oliver
to
rise
the
young
gentleman
took
him
to
an
adjacent
chandler
s
shop
where
he
purchased
a
sufficiency
of
ready
dressed
ham
and
a
half
quartern
loaf
or
as
he
himself
expressed
it
a
fourpenny
bran
the
ham
being
kept
clean
and
preserved
from
dust
by
the
ingenious
expedient
of
making
a
hole
in
the
loaf
by
pulling
out
a
portion
of
the
crumb
and
stuffing
it
therein
taking
the
bread
under
his
arm
the
young
gentleman
turned
into
a
small
public
house
and
led
the
way
to
a
tap
room
in
the
rear
of
the
premises
here
a
pot
of
beer
was
brought
in
by
direction
of
the
mysterious
youth
and
oliver
falling
to
at
his
new
friend
s
bidding
made
a
long
and
hearty
meal
during
the
progress
of
which
the
strange
boy
eyed
him
from
time
to
time
with
great
attention
going
to
london
said
the
strange
boy
when
oliver
had
at
length
concluded
yes
got
any
lodgings
no
money
no
the
strange
boy
whistled
and
put
his
arms
into
his
pockets
as
far
as
the
big
coat
sleeves
would
let
them
go
do
you
live
in
london
inquired
oliver
yes
i
do
when
i
m
at
home
replied
the
boy
i
suppose
you
want
some
place
to
sleep
in
tonight
don
t
you
i
do
indeed
answered
oliver
i
have
not
slept
under
a
roof
since
i
left
the
country
don
t
fret
your
eyelids
on
that
score
said
the
young
gentleman
i
ve
got
to
be
in
london
tonight
and
i
know
a
spectable
old
gentleman
as
lives
there
wot
ll
give
you
lodgings
for
nothink
and
never
ask
for
the
change
that
is
if
any
gentleman
he
knows
interduces
you
and
don
t
he
know
me
oh
no
not
in
the
least
by
no
means
certainly
not
the
young
gentleman
smiled
as
if
to
intimate
that
the
latter
fragments
of
discourse
were
playfully
ironical
and
finished
the
beer
as
he
did
so
this
unexpected
offer
of
shelter
was
too
tempting
to
be
resisted
especially
as
it
was
immediately
followed
up
by
the
assurance
that
the
old
gentleman
referred
to
would
doubtless
provide
oliver
with
a
comfortable
place
without
loss
of
time
this
led
to
a
more
friendly
and
confidential
dialogue
from
which
oliver
discovered
that
his
friend
s
name
was
jack
dawkins
and
that
he
was
a
peculiar
pet
and
prot
g
of
the
elderly
gentleman
before
mentioned
mr
dawkins
s
appearance
did
not
say
a
vast
deal
in
favour
of
the
comforts
which
his
patron
s
interest
obtained
for
those
whom
he
took
under
his
protection
but
as
he
had
a
rather
flightly
and
dissolute
mode
of
conversing
and
furthermore
avowed
that
among
his
intimate
friends
he
was
better
known
by
the
sobriquet
of
the
artful
dodger
oliver
concluded
that
being
of
a
dissipated
and
careless
turn
the
moral
precepts
of
his
benefactor
had
hitherto
been
thrown
away
upon
him
under
this
impression
he
secretly
resolved
to
cultivate
the
good
opinion
of
the
old
gentleman
as
quickly
as
possible
and
if
he
found
the
dodger
incorrigible
as
he
more
than
half
suspected
he
should
to
decline
the
honour
of
his
farther
acquaintance
as
john
dawkins
objected
to
their
entering
london
before
nightfall
it
was
nearly
eleven
o
clock
when
they
reached
the
turnpike
at
islington
they
crossed
from
the
angel
into
st
john
s
road
struck
down
the
small
street
which
terminates
at
sadler
s
wells
theatre
through
exmouth
street
and
coppice
row
down
the
little
court
by
the
side
of
the
workhouse
across
the
classic
ground
which
once
bore
the
name
of
hockley
in
the
hole
thence
into
little
saffron
hill
and
so
into
saffron
hill
the
great
along
which
the
dodger
scudded
at
a
rapid
pace
directing
oliver
to
follow
close
at
his
heels
although
oliver
had
enough
to
occupy
his
attention
in
keeping
sight
of
his
leader
he
could
not
help
bestowing
a
few
hasty
glances
on
either
side
of
the
way
as
he
passed
along
a
dirtier
or
more
wretched
place
he
had
never
seen
the
street
was
very
narrow
and
muddy
and
the
air
was
impregnated
with
filthy
odours
there
were
a
good
many
small
shops
but
the
only
stock
in
trade
appeared
to
be
heaps
of
children
who
even
at
that
time
of
night
were
crawling
in
and
out
at
the
doors
or
screaming
from
the
inside
the
sole
places
that
seemed
to
prosper
amid
the
general
blight
of
the
place
were
the
public
houses
and
in
them
the
lowest
orders
of
irish
were
wrangling
with
might
and
main
covered
ways
and
yards
which
here
and
there
diverged
from
the
main
street
disclosed
little
knots
of
houses
where
drunken
men
and
women
were
positively
wallowing
in
filth
and
from
several
of
the
door
ways
great
ill
looking
fellows
were
cautiously
emerging
bound
to
all
appearance
on
no
very
well
disposed
or
harmless
errands
oliver
was
just
considering
whether
he
hadn
t
better
run
away
when
they
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
his
conductor
catching
him
by
the
arm
pushed
open
the
door
of
a
house
near
field
lane
and
drawing
him
into
the
passage
closed
it
behind
them
now
then
