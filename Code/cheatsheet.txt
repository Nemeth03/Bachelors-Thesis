Number of Nodes
Total number of nodes in the graph.

Number of Edges
Total number of edges in the graph.

Max Degree
Node with the highest number of connections.

Min Degree
Node with the lowest number of connections.

Average Degree
Average number of connections per node.

Network Density
Measures how connected the graph is.
A value between 0 and 1.
0: The graph is completely disconnected (no edges).
1: The graph is fully connected (every node is connected to every other node).

Correlation (Degree vs Closeness)
This measures the relationship between degree centrality (how many direct connections a node has) 
and closeness centrality (how close a node is to all other nodes in terms of shortest paths).
Expected return:
A value between -1 and 1.
High positive correlation (close to 1): Nodes with many connections are also closer to other nodes in the network.
Low or negative correlation: Nodes with many connections are not necessarily closer to others.

Correlation (Degree vs Betweenness)
This measures the relationship between degree centrality (number of direct connections) 
and betweenness centrality (how often a node lies on the shortest paths between other nodes).
Expected return:
A value between -1 and 1.
High positive correlation (close to 1): Nodes with many connections also act as bridges or intermediaries in the network.
Low or negative correlation: Highly connected nodes do not necessarily play a bridging role.

Correlation (Closeness vs Betweenness)
This measures the relationship between closeness centrality (proximity to other nodes) 
and betweenness centrality (importance as a bridge between nodes).
Expected return:
A value between -1 and 1.
High positive correlation (close to 1): Nodes that are closer to others also act as important intermediaries.
Low or negative correlation: Nodes close to others do not necessarily play a bridging role in the network.

Average Clustering Coefficient
The clustering coefficient measures the likelihood that a node's neighbors are also connected to each other, forming a triangle (or cluster). 
The average clustering coefficient is the mean of the clustering coefficients of all nodes in the graph.
A value between 0 and 1.
0: No clustering (nodes' neighbors are not connected).
1: Perfect clustering (all neighbors of a node are connected to each other).

Average Shortest Path Length
The shortest path length between two nodes is the minimum number of edges required to travel from one node to the other. 
The average shortest path length is the mean of these shortest path lengths for all pairs of nodes in the graph.
A positive number representing the average number of steps between nodes.
Small value: Indicates a highly connected graph where nodes are close to each other.
Large value: Indicates a sparse graph where nodes are far apart.

Diameter
Longest shortest path in the graph.

Number of Words
Total number of unique words in the text.

Max/Min Word Length
Longest and shortest word lengths.

Average Word Length
Average length of words.

Number of Sentences
Total number of sentences in the text.

Max/Min Sentence Length
Longest and shortest sentence lengths (in words).

Average Sentence Length
Average number of words per sentence.

Number of Bigrams
A bigram is a sequence of two consecutive words in a text. 
The number of bigrams refers to the total count of unique two-word combinations found in the text.

Max/Min Bigram Frequency
Most and least frequent bigram occurrences.

Average Bigram Frequency
Average frequency of bigrams.

Number of Trigrams
A trigram is a sequence of three consecutive words in a text. 
The number of trigrams refers to the total count of unique three-word combinations found in the text.

Max/Min Trigram Frequency
Most and least frequent trigram occurrences.

Average Trigram Frequency
Average frequency of trigrams.
